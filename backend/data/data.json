            "description": "DCP Midstream Partners is the publicly traded entity of DCP Midstream LLC, one of the largest natural gas gatherers in North America and also the top producer and one of the primary marketers of natural gas liquids (NGLs). It also engages in natural gas compressing, treating, processing, transporting, and selling. DCP Midstream LLC also transports and sells NGLs and distributes propane wholesale. The company operates natural gas gathering systems (5,300 miles of pipe) in eight states (including Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas), seven processing plants, four NGL pipelines, and nine propane storage terminals. Spectra Energy holds a 50% holding in DCP (ConocoPhillips holds the other 50%).\n\nA consolidator in the fragmented natural gas gathering, NGLs, and wholesale propane industry segments, the company has been expanding its gas supply base and its propane wholesale network in recent years through strategic complementary acquisitions and joint ventures.\n\nIn 2012 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Texas-based Crossroads processing plant and gathering system from Penn Virginia Resource Partners for $63 million. The bolt-on acquisition allows the company to expand its market position in East Texas and provide services to drillers in the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley regions.\n\nIn 2011 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Seaway Products Pipeline Co. from ConocoPhillips. The pipeline, now called Southern Hills Pipeline and being converted to NGL service, is expected to be operational by mid-2013. It will provide NGL access from the Midcontinent to the Texas Gulf Coast.\n\nThe company agreed to form a joint venture with EQT Corporation to develop natural gas processing and related natural gas liquid (NGL) infrastructure in the Marcellus and Huron shale plays in the Appalachian basin. (However, the parties could not come to agreement and dropped the plan in early 2011). In 2010, the company acquired the Liberty gathering system and south Raywood processing plant from Ceritas Energy in southeast Texas. The pipeline system interconnects with DCP Midstream's Centana Intrastate Pipeline system.\n\nExpanding in Michigan, in 2009 the company acquired gas gathering and treating assets for $45.1 million. In 2010 it acquired a 350-mile interstate natural gas liquids pipeline system in Colorado's Denver-Julesburg Basin from Buckeye Partners for $22 million.\n\nIn 2010 DCP Midstream Partners moved to extend its Northeast wholesale propane business into the MidAtlantic region, acquiring UGI's Atlantic Energy for $49 million. That year it also purchased of NGL storage company Marysville Hydrocarbon Holdings (in Michigan) for about $95 million.\n\nAlthough DCP Midstream Partners' revenues suffered in 2009 as a result of the global recession and lower commodity prices, acquisitions and organic growth managed to offset lower natural gas volumes.  Acquisitions, increased demand, higher commodity and propane prices, and gains on derivatives help to lift the company's revenues and net income in 2010.\n\nIn terms of the company's origins, the D in DCP Midstream Partners (formerly Duke Energy Field Services) is for Duke Energy; the CP, ConocoPhillips. These two energy majors formed DCP Midstream Partners in 2005. Following the spinoff of Spectra Energy from Duke Energy in 2007, Spectra Energy assumed Duke Energy's 50% holding in DCP. \u2013 less",

Through Ameriprise Financial, Columbia Management, RiverSource, and other affiliates and brands, the company provides access to insurance, mutual funds, savings plans, personal trust services, retail brokerage, and other financial products and services. Its Ameriprise Bank subsidiary offers deposits and loans. Ameriprise, which has about $630 billion of assets under management, distributes its products primarily through a network of more than 9,700 financial advisors.\n\nThe company has been sharpening its focus on its branded adviser network. It sold its Securities America independent broker-dealer subsidiary to Ladenburg Thalmann for some $150 million in 2011. Shortly before the sale of the troubled unit, Ameriprise agreed to pay $160 million to settle claims that Securities America brokers sold securities in fraudulent companies.\n\nAmeriprise has been steadily boosting its assets under management and growing its client base (focusing on the affluent and mass affluent with at least $100,000 in investable assets). The company also is focused on geographic areas where those clients are congregated and has closed or consolidated offices in areas with less potential. While Columbia Management covers Ameriprise's main asset management market in the US, the company is increasing its global presence through its Threadneedle brand overseas. Ameriprise plans to grow its asset management operations in Europe, as well as in Australia, the Middle East, and Asia.\n\nAmeriprise's strategies have paid off. Volatile financial market conditions, which negatively impacted all of the company's operations, led to a decline in revenue in 2008 and 2009. However, the company returned to success in 2010 and revenues grew by more than 20% that year. Poor economic conditions continued in 2011. However, Ameriprise's operating net revenues climbed that year by about 10%. The boost was due to strong growth in the company's fee-based advisory and asset management businesses.\n\nAmeriprise Financial, which was founded in 1894, was spun off from American Express in 2005. \u2013 less",

The company's primary operations include the manufacture of building block chemicals like acetic acid and vinyl acetate monomers. Those chemicals are used in everything from inks and paints to agricultural products and chewing gum. Canadian subsidiary Acetex, the majority of whose sales come from Europe, is the world's largest acetyls manufacturer. Other products include acetate tow (in cigarette filters); industrial specialties like ethylene vinyl aceta; and engineered plastics. The bulk of sales come from the US and Germany. \n\nOperations\n\nCelanese operates through four business segments: Advanced Engineered Materials, Consumer Specialties, Industrial Specialties, and Acetyl Intermediates. The company is one of the world's largest producers of acetyl products, as well as a top global producer of engineered polymers.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nIn addition to manufacturing sites in the US, it also has properties, plants, and equipment in Belgium, China, Canada, Germany, Mexico, and Singapore.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nCelanese continued its recovery from the recession of 2008-09 with a 14% increase in revenues in 2011, due primarily to higher volumes and increased sales prices across most of its business segments. The largest gains were in its Industrial Specialties unit (up 18%), Advanced Engineered Materials unit (up 17%), and its Acetyl Intermediates segment (up 15%). Net income grew by 61% in 2011, as increased revenues outpaced a more modest growth in operating expenses.\n\nStrategy\n\nCelanese's strategy is to grow the company through expansion into emerging regions, particularly China; to offer innovation through developing new products and applications; increase its productivity through energy reduction, business process improvements, and manufacturing optimization; and boost its portfolio by growing its business through both acquisitions or internal growth.\n\nIn 2012 the company teamed up with Indonesia's Pertamina, forming a joint venture to develop fuel ethanol projects in that country.\n\nTo grow its emulsion polymers business, in 2011 the company acquired two product lines, Vinac and Flexbond, from Ashland. The acquisition is expected to speed up growth of the company's emulsion polymers operations throughout the Americas -- especially in the adhesives, textiles, coatings, and paper segments.\n\nCelanese subsidiary Ticona Engineering Polymers acquired two product lines, Zenite liquid crystal polymer and Thermx polycyclohexylene-dimethylene terephthalate, from DuPont Performance Polymers division in 2010. The units expanded Celanese's offerings in the electrical and electronics application segments of the global polymers market. \n\nOwnership\n\nIn 2012 Capital Research Global Investors owned about 11% of Celanese, with several other investment firms owning a smaller stakes.\n\nCompany Background\n\nCelanese Corporation was created in 2004 by the Blackstone Group, which had acquired a majority share in Celanese AG, turned it private, and then flipped it in a 2005 public offering. Blackstone finally divested its remaining holdings in Celanese in 2007. \u2013 less",

            "description": "Ameren provides the power that makes much of the American Midwest run. The holding company distributes electricity to 2.4 million customers and natural gas to 900,000 customers in Missouri and Illinois through utility subsidiaries. Ameren has a generating capacity of 16,000 MW (primarily coal-fired), most of which is controlled by utility Union Electric (which does business as Ameren Missouri) and nonregulated subsidiary AmerenEnergy Resources Generating Company. Ameren, which also supplies merchant generation power to third parties, operates a nuclear power facility, three hydroelectric plants, and several coal-fired plants and turbine combustion facilities. It also purchases power, including windpower.\n\nOperations\n\nIn addition to operating power plants, Ameren procures natural gas for its affiliated companies, builds new power plants, and provides long-term energy supply contracts. It also markets and trades electricity to wholesale and retail customers and provides risk management and other energy-related services.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nAmeren's overall revenues dipped in 2011. While increased rates helped to lift Ameren Missouri's revenues in 2011, Ameren Illinois' regulated segment and the merchant generation segment both reported a drop in revenues. In particular, low gas prices and a warm winter hurt gas revenues. However, lower purchased power and resale gas, coupled with a drop in goodwill, impairment, and other charges, helped to lift Ameren's net income for the year.\n\nFavorable weather conditions (which increased energy demand) and rate increases help to lift the company's revenues in 2010. However, impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets in the merchant generation segment (due to the sustained decline in market prices for electricity) dragged down Ameren's operating income.\n\nStrategy\n\nIn 2010 the company combined AmerenIP, AmerenCIPS, and AmerenCILCO into one entity, Ameren Illinois, in order to streamline operations and reduce confusion among customers. The three Illinois utilities have operated as a single business since 2004 and deliver energy to more than 1,100 communities. Ameren Illinois also operates some 21,400 miles of natural gas distribution and transmission lines.\n\nTo comply with federal requirements to separate ownership of power generation and transmission businesses, the operations of Ameren subsidiaries' transmission assets are under the control ofMidwest Independent Transmission System Operator, a regional transmission organization that coordinates power across 15 Midwestern states and one Canadian Province.  \u2013 less",

            "description": "Independent oil and gas producer Devon Energy puts its energy into oil and gas fields far from England's southwestern coast, in North America. It focuses on exploration and production assets in Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming, and western Canada. In 2011 Devon Energy reported proved reserves of 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent (58% natural gas) and more than 19,900 net acres of assets. It also drilled almost 2,500 gross wells. Devon Energy produces about 2.5 billion cu. ft. of natural gas a day (more than 3% of all the gas consumed in North America). The company is the largest producer and lease holder in the Barnett Shale (Texas) and is looking to replicate its success there to other unconventional plays.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nOnce active in major oil patches worldwide such as Azerbaijan, Brazil, and China, in the mid-2000s the company decided to focus on safer and increasingly productive unconventional onshore exploration opportunities (shales and oil sands) in North America. As a result, Devon Energy has sold all of its international assets.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nDevon Energy posted a major improvement in revenues in 2010, thanks to higher commodity prices and an increase in production. In 2011, buoyed by record level reserves, high oil prices, and an increased demand for oil and gas products, the company posted a further 15% growth in revenues. Net income only rose by 3%, however, as higher operating, depreciation, deletion, and amortization costs and an increase in deferred income tax expense trimmed income growth.\n\nBoosting its financial resources, in 2012 Devon Energy secured a commitment from Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration & Production for the Chinese company to invest $2.2 billion in exchange for one-third of Devon's interest in five new joint venture plays in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, Niobrara, Mississippian, Ohio Utica Shale, and the Michigan Basin.\n\nThat year it also closed a similar $1.4 billion joint venture deal with Sumitomo Corp. to develop 650,000 net acres in the Cline Shale and the Midland-Wolfcamp Shale in West Texas.\n\nStrategy\n\nIn 2010 it sold most of its remaining international assets to BP for $7 billion. As part of this deal BP sold undeveloped oil sand leases in Canada to Devon Energy for $500 million and formed a joint venture with the company to exploit them. The company also sold its Panyu field, offshore China, to China National Offshore Oil for $515 million.\n\nConsolidating its North American assets to just its onshore properties, In 2010 Devon Energy sold its stakes in the Cascade, Jack and St. Malo fields in the Gulf of Mexico (about 200 million barrels of estimated recoverable reserves) to AP Moller-Maersk's oil unit for $1.3 billion. It also sold its remaining Gulf of Mexico shelf assets to Apache for $1 billion. \u2013 less",

            "description": "Xcel Energy has accelerated its energy engine in utility markets across the US. The utility holding company distributes electricity to 3.4 million customers and natural gas to 1.9 million in eight states through four regulated utilities; Colorado and Minnesota account for most of its customers. Its utilities -- Northern States Power (NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin), Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service (in New Mexico and Texas) -- have the combined capacity of more than 17,150 MW of electricity. Xcel owns transmission and distribution lines, as well as natural gas assets. It is also the top wind power provider in the US, with wind farms in Colorado, Minnesota, and Texas.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nThe company serves customers in Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin.\n\n \n\nOperations\n\nXcel operates power and gas utilities: Northern States Power, Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service. The holding company has more than 80 generating plants, more than 87,750 miles of transmission lines and about 191,840 miles of distribution lines. It also operates an interstate natural gas pipeline company and a joint venture to develop and lease natural gas pipelines, storage, and compression assets.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nIn 2011 Xcel reported a 3% jump in sales due to an increase in demand caused by a warmer-than-normal summer and a colder-than-normal winter. It was also assisted by a 3.7% increase in the electric segment due to cost recovery of the acquisition of the Rocky Mountain and Blue Spruce natural gas facilities by Public Service Company of Colorado and by natural gas retail rate increases in Minnesota.\n\nNet income rose by 11% thanks to higher revenues and lower electric fuel and purchased power costs.\n\nHigher rates and increased weather-related demand helped sales in 2010 to rise nearly 7%, going from $9.6 billion to about $10.3 billion. \n\nStrategy\n\nXcel is an energy company in transition, with long-term plans to move from coal-fired plants to natural gas, and on to alternative fuels such as wind, solar, and biomass to boost its green  power capacity (88,705 MWh by 2015).\n\nIn 2012 the company was seeking proposals for renewable resources other than wind or solar as part of its plan to diversify Southwestern Public Service Company  renewable energy portfolio.\n\nAs the largest US utility wind energy provider, Xcel controlled some 3,500 MW of wind energy in its portfolio in 2011 and plans to have 7,400 MW by 2020. In 2011 Xcel bought the 200 MW Limon Wind Energy Center, which will have 125 turbines in Lincoln and Elbert counties on Colorado's Front Range east of Denver. The company is also the US's fifth-largest utility solar energy provider and owns the fourth-largest transmission system. In addition, Xcel operates more than 25 hydroelectric power plants in Colorado, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.\n\nThe company believes its strategy of making environmentally sound investments is pivotal to its success. Among its 2010 projects were launching its 800-MW coal-fired unit in Colorado, known as Comanche 3, after installing advanced emission-reduction equipment. It also began construction of its CapX2020 project, a joint venture transmission expansion project with 10 other utilities, scheduled for completion by 2020. The project includes a 240-mile transmission line from Minnesota to North Dakota. The company has filed to extend the licensing plants of its two nuclear plants on Prairie Island in Minnesota for 20 years, which it expects to save customers more than $1 billion compared to alternative sources.\n\nXcel plans to construct one of the largest biomass generating plants in the Midwest. The facility, proposed for the Bay Front Generating Station in Ashland, Wisconsin, will generate power from burning wood waste in all three operating units by 2014. In 2011 Xcel had 73 MW of biomass generating power in Minnesota and Wisconsin.\n\nXcel is also working to develop so-called \"smart grid\" technology, which will provide customers with more reliability and control over their energy use. It has completed the nation's first fully integrated SmartGridCity in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nIn 2010 Xcel acquired two gas-fired power plants from Calpine Corporation for $739 million. The two Denver-area plants have a generating capacity of more than 900 MW and were already providing power to Public Service Company of Colorado under a contract agreement. The company is planning to acquire 775 MW of new wind-power capacity for its Colorado system over the next several years. \u2013 less",

It focuses on exploration and production assets in Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming, and western Canada. In 2011 Devon Energy reported proved reserves of 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent (58% natural gas) and more than 19,900 net acres of assets. It also drilled almost 2,500 gross wells. Devon Energy produces about 2.5 billion cu. ft. of natural gas a day (more than 3% of all the gas consumed in North America). The company is the largest producer and lease holder in the Barnett Shale (Texas) and is looking to replicate its success there to other unconventional plays.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nOnce active in major oil patches worldwide such as Azerbaijan, Brazil, and China, in the mid-2000s the company decided to focus on safer and increasingly productive unconventional onshore exploration opportunities (shales and oil sands) in North America. As a result, Devon Energy has sold all of its international assets.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nDevon Energy posted a major improvement in revenues in 2010, thanks to higher commodity prices and an increase in production. In 2011, buoyed by record level reserves, high oil prices, and an increased demand for oil and gas products, the company posted a further 15% growth in revenues. Net income only rose by 3%, however, as higher operating, depreciation, deletion, and amortization costs and an increase in deferred income tax expense trimmed income growth.\n\nBoosting its financial resources, in 2012 Devon Energy secured a commitment from Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration & Production for the Chinese company to invest $2.2 billion in exchange for one-third of Devon's interest in five new joint venture plays in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, Niobrara, Mississippian, Ohio Utica Shale, and the Michigan Basin.\n\nThat year it also closed a similar $1.4 billion joint venture deal with Sumitomo Corp. to develop 650,000 net acres in the Cline Shale and the Midland-Wolfcamp Shale in West Texas.\n\nStrategy\n\nIn 2010 it sold most of its remaining international assets to BP for $7 billion. As part of this deal BP sold undeveloped oil sand leases in Canada to Devon Energy for $500 million and formed a joint venture with the company to exploit them. The company also sold its Panyu field, offshore China, to China National Offshore Oil for $515 million.\n\nConsolidating its North American assets to just its onshore properties, In 2010 Devon Energy sold its stakes in the Cascade, Jack and St. Malo fields in the Gulf of Mexico (about 200 million barrels of estimated recoverable reserves) to AP Moller-Maersk's oil unit for $1.3 billion. It also sold its remaining Gulf of Mexico shelf assets to Apache for $1 billion. \u2013 less",

A part of top US power firm Duke Energy, the regulated utility provides electricity services to about 2.4 million customers in North and South Carolina. Operating in a 24,000-square mile service territory, Duke Energy Carolinas has 101,400 miles of distribution cable. Its transmission system spans 13,100 miles. The utility has a net generating capacity of about 19,200 MW from interests in fossil-fueled, nuclear, and hydroelectric power plants. Duke Energy Carolinas also sells power to wholesale customers.\n\nThe utility's three nuclear plants account for more than a quarter of Duke Energy Carolinas' generating capacity.\n\nDuke Energy Carolinas is investing $7 billion from 2010 to 2012 to expand its generating capacity and maintain its nuclear fuel and plants. By 2020 the company is looking to expand capacity by 5,400 MW, a strategy that brings new plants online while replacing older, less efficient ones.\n\nThe global recession produced weaker demand for power (especially from industrial customers) which lowered company revenues in 2009. However, the same downturn cut fuel expenses (including purchased power from third parties) resulting in only a slight dip in Duke Energy Carolinas' operating income.\n\nIn 2010 the company saw its revenues rise, primarily due to new retail electric base rates in North Carolina and South Carolina, and favorable weather conditions which spurred demand. Duke Energy Carolinas also posted higher net income, despite an increase in fuel costs and expenses related to an employee voluntary severance plan. \u2013 less",

            "description": "When it comes to data storage, Western Digital has drive. The company is one of the largest independent makers of hard-disk drives, which record, store, and recall volumes of data. Drives for PCs account for most of Western Digital's sales, although the company also makes devices used in servers, cloud computing data centers, and home entertainment products such as set-top boxes and video game consoles. The company sells to manufacturers and through retailers and distributors. More than 60% of its sales are to OEMs such as  Hewlett-Packard, which is Western Digital's largest customer. The company gets more than half of its sales from the Asia/Pacific region.\n\nOperations\n\nWestern Digital is structured around two subsidiaries: WD Technologies and Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST). Each subsidiary maintains its own brand and product lines, with separate sales, marketing, operations, and product development teams. The company is looking to offer improved customer experiences for competing and complementary brands, while finding efficiencies in shared services.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nThe company is seeing strong growth in Asia (which represents more than 55% of sales) and the US (nearly 20%), with slower growth in the EMEA region (another nearly 20%). Western Digital has manufacturing facilities in the US and across Asia and sales offices worldwide.\n\nStrategy\n\nWestern Digital is one of a handful of manufacturers that dominate the hard-disk drive market -- a sector characterized by harsh competition, short product life cycles, and aggressive price cuts. In order to reduce its dependence on drives for PCs, the company has branched into branded consumer media devices, including DVR expanders, portable media drives, and media players that let users play data from external drives on TV. Its WD TV Live Plus media player streams movies (including those offered by Netflix) and Internet video to a digital TV. It is also investing in products for the mobile computing and cloud computing markets.\n\nAnother promising market for Western Digital is nearline hard drives, which are more cost effective than traditional hard drives by providing more capacity while requiring lower power. Nearline hard drives are used for stimulated applications, such as video surveillance and medical imaging, and IT infrastructure applications, including scientific computing and Web search engines.\n\nMergers & Acquisitions\n\nIn 2012 Western Digital bought Hitachi's disk drive business, HGST, for around $4.3 billion in cash and stock. The deal boosts Western Digital's share of the global market to nearly 50%, ahead of rival Seagate Technology which accounts for around 30% of global shipments. Strategically, the deal adds disk drives used with servers -- a large part of both Hitachi and Seagate's businesses -- and gives Western Digital a better foothold in solid-state drives used in tablets and other portable devices. The acquisition also provides Western Digital its first manufacturing foothold in China and the Philippines. With the stock portion of the sale, Hitachi gains a 10% stake in Western Digital and two spots on the board of directors.\n\nWestern Digital has long used acquisitions to add new product lines and extend its geographic reach. Over the past several years it bought the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya for about $233 million and entered the market for solid-state drives with the $65 million purchase of SiliconSystems. In a large 2007 acquisition, Western Digital bought disk component maker Komag for $1 billion, which gave it the ability to manufacture the media and substrates used in its drives.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nWestern Digital's sales have fluctuated in recent years as it has dealt with the worldwide economic downturn. However, its acquisition of HGST helped produce strong results for fiscal 2012 (ended June 30). The company's revenues grew 31% that year to $12.5 billion, with HGST contributing more than $3 billion of that. It also saw an improvement in hard drive average selling price from $45 in fiscal 2011 to $62 in fiscal 2012.\n\nAlthough Western Digital saw increased R&D and SG&A expenses in 2012, the overall strength of revenues led to a 122% jump in net income (to $1.6 billion). \u2013 less",

As the primary operating subsidiary of Pacific Mutual Holding Company, Pacific Life offers a wide range of life insurance, asset management, and financial services products, including individual annuities and mutual funds. It also offers a variety of investment products and services for individuals, businesses, and pension plans. Subsidiary Pacific Life & Annuity offers the same mix of life insurance and investment products and services for individuals and businesses in New York. Pacific Life was founded in 1868.\n\nOperations\n\nPacific Life policyholders are members of parent Pacific Mutual Holding Company, which was created in 1997 following a conversion to the mutual holding company structure. Pacific LifeCorp is the intermediate stock holding company.\n\nWhile life insurance is the company's bread and butter, it has brought in other operations for variety. Pacific Life's Aviation Capital Group subsidiary leases commercial jets to 90 airlines in more than 40 countries. It also manages aircraft assets for third parties such as commercial airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and financial institutions. Other subsidiaries include Pacific Asset Management, which provides third-party institutional asset management.\n\nSales & Marketing\n\nPacific Life's insurance policies are sold through independent distributors and through dealer/broker subsidiary Pacific Select Distributors.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nThe company's growth strategies helped Pacific Life achieve strong results in 2011, with revenues increasing 15% over 2010 to almost 6.7 billion, and net income increasing 29% to $679 million. Its operating income climbed a whopping 40% over 2010 to reach $823 million. The gains achieved were attributed to enhanced service offerings, expanded life insurance, annuity, and mutual fund product offerings, and the two acquisitions made that year.\n\nStrategy\n\nBeing a mutual company, Pacific Life operates with a long-term focus to serve in the best interests of its policyholders and clients. in doing so, the company navigated the chilly economic waters of the 2008-2009 recession by steadily introducing new products and building up its capital reserves. By 2010 its net income had grown as risk-weary customers squirreled more of their savings and retirement monies into life insurance and mutual funds.\n\nMergers, Acquisitions & Divestitures\n\nIn 2008 the company added international reinsurance to its portfolio when it acquired the former London-based specialty reinsurance operations of Scottish Re and renamed the business as Pacific Life Re. It then added life retrocession (reinsurance of a reinsurer) to its line-up in 2011 by acquiring that business from Manulife and expanded its business to include the Toronto, Boston, Barbados, and Cologne markets.\n\nAlso in 2011 Pacific life bought JPMorgan Chase's pension risk advisory business to form Pacific Global Advisors. The unit offers risk management solutions and advisory services to pension plan sponsors.\n\nThe firm divested a noncore business, College Savings Bank, in 2012 to a syndicate of investors for an undisclosed price. The banking unit managed two state-sponsored 529 college savings plans. \u2013 less",

            "description": "When it comes to data storage, Western Digital has drive. The company is one of the largest independent makers of hard-disk drives, which record, store, and recall volumes of data. Drives for PCs account for most of Western Digital's sales, although the company also makes devices used in servers, cloud computing data centers, and home entertainment products such as set-top boxes and video game consoles. The company sells to manufacturers and through retailers and distributors. More than 60% of its sales are to OEMs such as  Hewlett-Packard, which is Western Digital's largest customer. The company gets more than half of its sales from the Asia/Pacific region.\n\nOperations\n\nWestern Digital is structured around two subsidiaries: WD Technologies and Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST). Each subsidiary maintains its own brand and product lines, with separate sales, marketing, operations, and product development teams. The company is looking to offer improved customer experiences for competing and complementary brands, while finding efficiencies in shared services.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nThe company is seeing strong growth in Asia (which represents more than 55% of sales) and the US (nearly 20%), with slower growth in the EMEA region (another nearly 20%). Western Digital has manufacturing facilities in the US and across Asia and sales offices worldwide.\n\nStrategy\n\nWestern Digital is one of a handful of manufacturers that dominate the hard-disk drive market -- a sector characterized by harsh competition, short product life cycles, and aggressive price cuts. In order to reduce its dependence on drives for PCs, the company has branched into branded consumer media devices, including DVR expanders, portable media drives, and media players that let users play data from external drives on TV. Its WD TV Live Plus media player streams movies (including those offered by Netflix) and Internet video to a digital TV. It is also investing in products for the mobile computing and cloud computing markets.\n\nAnother promising market for Western Digital is nearline hard drives, which are more cost effective than traditional hard drives by providing more capacity while requiring lower power. Nearline hard drives are used for stimulated applications, such as video surveillance and medical imaging, and IT infrastructure applications, including scientific computing and Web search engines.\n\nMergers & Acquisitions\n\nIn 2012 Western Digital bought Hitachi's disk drive business, HGST, for around $4.3 billion in cash and stock. The deal boosts Western Digital's share of the global market to nearly 50%, ahead of rival Seagate Technology which accounts for around 30% of global shipments. Strategically, the deal adds disk drives used with servers -- a large part of both Hitachi and Seagate's businesses -- and gives Western Digital a better foothold in solid-state drives used in tablets and other portable devices. The acquisition also provides Western Digital its first manufacturing foothold in China and the Philippines. With the stock portion of the sale, Hitachi gains a 10% stake in Western Digital and two spots on the board of directors.\n\nWestern Digital has long used acquisitions to add new product lines and extend its geographic reach. Over the past several years it bought the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya for about $233 million and entered the market for solid-state drives with the $65 million purchase of SiliconSystems. In a large 2007 acquisition, Western Digital bought disk component maker Komag for $1 billion, which gave it the ability to manufacture the media and substrates used in its drives.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nWestern Digital's sales have fluctuated in recent years as it has dealt with the worldwide economic downturn. However, its acquisition of HGST helped produce strong results for fiscal 2012 (ended June 30). The company's revenues grew 31% that year to $12.5 billion, with HGST contributing more than $3 billion of that. It also saw an improvement in hard drive average selling price from $45 in fiscal 2011 to $62 in fiscal 2012.\n\nAlthough Western Digital saw increased R&D and SG&A expenses in 2012, the overall strength of revenues led to a 122% jump in net income (to $1.6 billion). \u2013 less",

The company was forced to create an interim headquarters in Clinton, Mississippi (a suburb of Jackson).\n\nThe mass evacuation and property damage caused by Hurricane Katrina severely reduced the population served by Entergy New Orleans. Before the big storm it had more than 190,000 electric customers and more than 144,000 gas customers.\n\nThe company reported a 10% drop in net revenue in 2011 due to lower electric rates and weak gas prices. However, net income jumped by $4.9 million thanks to lower operational and maintenance expenses, lower taxes, and lower interest expense.\n\nTo gain better financial returns, Entergy  plans to spin off its transmission businesses (including Entergy New Orleans') and merge them with a subsidiary of ITC Holdings.\n\nIn 2012, as part of a strategy to improve customer relations, Entergy New Orleans introduced a smartphone app to keep customers better informed about company and energy-related matters. \u2013 less",

The bank is primarily active in the UK, where it has some 1,700 branches, but also has significant retail and commercial operations in Europe, Africa (it owns more than half of South African bank Absa Group), the Middle East, and the US. Barclays Bank offers standard retail services such as deposit accounts and lending, including Woolwich-brand mortgages. The bank also provides commercial money transfer services, insurance products, the Barclaycard line of credit cards, and financial advisory services. Barclays Bank traces its roots to the late 17th century.\n\nBarclays Bank has been building up its portfolio of global credit card accounts, especially as other financial groups sell off noncore units during the economic recovery. In 2010 the company acquired the Italian credit card accounts of Citigroup in a deal that included some 197,000 card accounts and approximately \u20ac234 million ($320 million) worth of assets. It previously bought Goldfish, the struggling UK credit card unit of Discover Financial Services, for some \u00a346 million ($70 million). In 2011 Barclays acquired Egg UK's credit card portfolio, which added more than 1 million accounts; it has agreed to buy more Citibank card accounts.\n\nThe bank has also been offloading some of its own holdings as part of an overall corporate restructuring. In 2010 Barclays sold its US subprime loan servicing business, HomEq Servicing, to Ocwen Financial. It also announced plans to abandon retail banking in certain international markets and instead focus on wholesale and commercial banking. In 2011 it shuttered its Indonesian retail unit Bank Akita, which it had acquired only two years before. The company also sold its Russian retail and commercial operations to a group of investors, citing difficulties competing in the market. Barclays will instead focus on its investment banking activities in the region.\n\nIn 2010 Barclays acquired Standard Life Bank from Standard Life for \u00a3226 million ($369 million). The deal added Standard Life's savings and mortgage books to the Barclays fold. Also as part of the deal, Barclays and Standard Life entered into a partnership whereby Barclays markets pension products to its clients.\n\nDespite challenges in the economy, especially in regards to Europe's debt problems, Barclays Bank's revenues grew 8% in 2011. Its Africa business performed relatively strongly, with credit impairments improving, as did Barclaycard, thanks to the portfolio acquisitions which delivered profits. That year the bank closed nearly 150 European branches (largely located in Spain), the costs of which contributed to a 5% decline in net income. \u2013 less",

The bank is primarily active in the UK, where it has some 1,700 branches, but also has significant retail and commercial operations in Europe, Africa (it owns more than half of South African bank Absa Group), the Middle East, and the US. Barclays Bank offers standard retail services such as deposit accounts and lending, including Woolwich-brand mortgages. The bank also provides commercial money transfer services, insurance products, the Barclaycard line of credit cards, and financial advisory services. Barclays Bank traces its roots to the late 17th century.\n\nBarclays Bank has been building up its portfolio of global credit card accounts, especially as other financial groups sell off noncore units during the economic recovery. In 2010 the company acquired the Italian credit card accounts of Citigroup in a deal that included some 197,000 card accounts and approximately \u20ac234 million ($320 million) worth of assets. It previously bought Goldfish, the struggling UK credit card unit of Discover Financial Services, for some \u00a346 million ($70 million). In 2011 Barclays acquired Egg UK's credit card portfolio, which added more than 1 million accounts; it has agreed to buy more Citibank card accounts.\n\nThe bank has also been offloading some of its own holdings as part of an overall corporate restructuring. In 2010 Barclays sold its US subprime loan servicing business, HomEq Servicing, to Ocwen Financial. It also announced plans to abandon retail banking in certain international markets and instead focus on wholesale and commercial banking. In 2011 it shuttered its Indonesian retail unit Bank Akita, which it had acquired only two years before. The company also sold its Russian retail and commercial operations to a group of investors, citing difficulties competing in the market. Barclays will instead focus on its investment banking activities in the region.\n\nIn 2010 Barclays acquired Standard Life Bank from Standard Life for \u00a3226 million ($369 million). The deal added Standard Life's savings and mortgage books to the Barclays fold. Also as part of the deal, Barclays and Standard Life entered into a partnership whereby Barclays markets pension products to its clients.\n\nDespite challenges in the economy, especially in regards to Europe's debt problems, Barclays Bank's revenues grew 8% in 2011. Its Africa business performed relatively strongly, with credit impairments improving, as did Barclaycard, thanks to the portfolio acquisitions which delivered profits. That year the bank closed nearly 150 European branches (largely located in Spain), the costs of which contributed to a 5% decline in net income. \u2013 less",

It also engages in natural gas compressing, treating, processing, transporting, and selling. DCP Midstream LLC also transports and sells NGLs and distributes propane wholesale. The company operates natural gas gathering systems (5,300 miles of pipe) in eight states (including Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas), seven processing plants, four NGL pipelines, and nine propane storage terminals. Spectra Energy holds a 50% holding in DCP (ConocoPhillips holds the other 50%).\n\nA consolidator in the fragmented natural gas gathering, NGLs, and wholesale propane industry segments, the company has been expanding its gas supply base and its propane wholesale network in recent years through strategic complementary acquisitions and joint ventures.\n\nIn 2012 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Texas-based Crossroads processing plant and gathering system from Penn Virginia Resource Partners for $63 million. The bolt-on acquisition allows the company to expand its market position in East Texas and provide services to drillers in the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley regions.\n\nIn 2011 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Seaway Products Pipeline Co. from ConocoPhillips. The pipeline, now called Southern Hills Pipeline and being converted to NGL service, is expected to be operational by mid-2013. It will provide NGL access from the Midcontinent to the Texas Gulf Coast.\n\nThe company agreed to form a joint venture with EQT Corporation to develop natural gas processing and related natural gas liquid (NGL) infrastructure in the Marcellus and Huron shale plays in the Appalachian basin. (However, the parties could not come to agreement and dropped the plan in early 2011). In 2010, the company acquired the Liberty gathering system and south Raywood processing plant from Ceritas Energy in southeast Texas. The pipeline system interconnects with DCP Midstream's Centana Intrastate Pipeline system.\n\nExpanding in Michigan, in 2009 the company acquired gas gathering and treating assets for $45.1 million. In 2010 it acquired a 350-mile interstate natural gas liquids pipeline system in Colorado's Denver-Julesburg Basin from Buckeye Partners for $22 million.\n\nIn 2010 DCP Midstream Partners moved to extend its Northeast wholesale propane business into the MidAtlantic region, acquiring UGI's Atlantic Energy for $49 million. That year it also purchased of NGL storage company Marysville Hydrocarbon Holdings (in Michigan) for about $95 million.\n\nAlthough DCP Midstream Partners' revenues suffered in 2009 as a result of the global recession and lower commodity prices, acquisitions and organic growth managed to offset lower natural gas volumes.  Acquisitions, increased demand, higher commodity and propane prices, and gains on derivatives help to lift the company's revenues and net income in 2010.\n\nIn terms of the company's origins, the D in DCP Midstream Partners (formerly Duke Energy Field Services) is for Duke Energy; the CP, ConocoPhillips. These two energy majors formed DCP Midstream Partners in 2005. Following the spinoff of Spectra Energy from Duke Energy in 2007, Spectra Energy assumed Duke Energy's 50% holding in DCP. \u2013 less",

The company's primary operations include the manufacture of building block chemicals like acetic acid and vinyl acetate monomers. Those chemicals are used in everything from inks and paints to agricultural products and chewing gum. Canadian subsidiary Acetex, the majority of whose sales come from Europe, is the world's largest acetyls manufacturer. Other products include acetate tow (in cigarette filters); industrial specialties like ethylene vinyl aceta; and engineered plastics. The bulk of sales come from the US and Germany. \n\nOperations\n\nCelanese operates through four business segments: Advanced Engineered Materials, Consumer Specialties, Industrial Specialties, and Acetyl Intermediates. The company is one of the world's largest producers of acetyl products, as well as a top global producer of engineered polymers.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nIn addition to manufacturing sites in the US, it also has properties, plants, and equipment in Belgium, China, Canada, Germany, Mexico, and Singapore.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nCelanese continued its recovery from the recession of 2008-09 with a 14% increase in revenues in 2011, due primarily to higher volumes and increased sales prices across most of its business segments. The largest gains were in its Industrial Specialties unit (up 18%), Advanced Engineered Materials unit (up 17%), and its Acetyl Intermediates segment (up 15%). Net income grew by 61% in 2011, as increased revenues outpaced a more modest growth in operating expenses.\n\nStrategy\n\nCelanese's strategy is to grow the company through expansion into emerging regions, particularly China; to offer innovation through developing new products and applications; increase its productivity through energy reduction, business process improvements, and manufacturing optimization; and boost its portfolio by growing its business through both acquisitions or internal growth.\n\nIn 2012 the company teamed up with Indonesia's Pertamina, forming a joint venture to develop fuel ethanol projects in that country.\n\nTo grow its emulsion polymers business, in 2011 the company acquired two product lines, Vinac and Flexbond, from Ashland. The acquisition is expected to speed up growth of the company's emulsion polymers operations throughout the Americas -- especially in the adhesives, textiles, coatings, and paper segments.\n\nCelanese subsidiary Ticona Engineering Polymers acquired two product lines, Zenite liquid crystal polymer and Thermx polycyclohexylene-dimethylene terephthalate, from DuPont Performance Polymers division in 2010. The units expanded Celanese's offerings in the electrical and electronics application segments of the global polymers market. \n\nOwnership\n\nIn 2012 Capital Research Global Investors owned about 11% of Celanese, with several other investment firms owning a smaller stakes.\n\nCompany Background\n\nCelanese Corporation was created in 2004 by the Blackstone Group, which had acquired a majority share in Celanese AG, turned it private, and then flipped it in a 2005 public offering. Blackstone finally divested its remaining holdings in Celanese in 2007. \u2013 less",

            "description": "Xcel Energy has accelerated its energy engine in utility markets across the US. The utility holding company distributes electricity to 3.4 million customers and natural gas to 1.9 million in eight states through four regulated utilities; Colorado and Minnesota account for most of its customers. Its utilities -- Northern States Power (NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin), Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service (in New Mexico and Texas) -- have the combined capacity of more than 17,150 MW of electricity. Xcel owns transmission and distribution lines, as well as natural gas assets. It is also the top wind power provider in the US, with wind farms in Colorado, Minnesota, and Texas.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nThe company serves customers in Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin.\n\n \n\nOperations\n\nXcel operates power and gas utilities: Northern States Power, Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service. The holding company has more than 80 generating plants, more than 87,750 miles of transmission lines and about 191,840 miles of distribution lines. It also operates an interstate natural gas pipeline company and a joint venture to develop and lease natural gas pipelines, storage, and compression assets.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nIn 2011 Xcel reported a 3% jump in sales due to an increase in demand caused by a warmer-than-normal summer and a colder-than-normal winter. It was also assisted by a 3.7% increase in the electric segment due to cost recovery of the acquisition of the Rocky Mountain and Blue Spruce natural gas facilities by Public Service Company of Colorado and by natural gas retail rate increases in Minnesota.\n\nNet income rose by 11% thanks to higher revenues and lower electric fuel and purchased power costs.\n\nHigher rates and increased weather-related demand helped sales in 2010 to rise nearly 7%, going from $9.6 billion to about $10.3 billion. \n\nStrategy\n\nXcel is an energy company in transition, with long-term plans to move from coal-fired plants to natural gas, and on to alternative fuels such as wind, solar, and biomass to boost its green  power capacity (88,705 MWh by 2015).\n\nIn 2012 the company was seeking proposals for renewable resources other than wind or solar as part of its plan to diversify Southwestern Public Service Company  renewable energy portfolio.\n\nAs the largest US utility wind energy provider, Xcel controlled some 3,500 MW of wind energy in its portfolio in 2011 and plans to have 7,400 MW by 2020. In 2011 Xcel bought the 200 MW Limon Wind Energy Center, which will have 125 turbines in Lincoln and Elbert counties on Colorado's Front Range east of Denver. The company is also the US's fifth-largest utility solar energy provider and owns the fourth-largest transmission system. In addition, Xcel operates more than 25 hydroelectric power plants in Colorado, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.\n\nThe company believes its strategy of making environmentally sound investments is pivotal to its success. Among its 2010 projects were launching its 800-MW coal-fired unit in Colorado, known as Comanche 3, after installing advanced emission-reduction equipment. It also began construction of its CapX2020 project, a joint venture transmission expansion project with 10 other utilities, scheduled for completion by 2020. The project includes a 240-mile transmission line from Minnesota to North Dakota. The company has filed to extend the licensing plants of its two nuclear plants on Prairie Island in Minnesota for 20 years, which it expects to save customers more than $1 billion compared to alternative sources.\n\nXcel plans to construct one of the largest biomass generating plants in the Midwest. The facility, proposed for the Bay Front Generating Station in Ashland, Wisconsin, will generate power from burning wood waste in all three operating units by 2014. In 2011 Xcel had 73 MW of biomass generating power in Minnesota and Wisconsin.\n\nXcel is also working to develop so-called \"smart grid\" technology, which will provide customers with more reliability and control over their energy use. It has completed the nation's first fully integrated SmartGridCity in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nIn 2010 Xcel acquired two gas-fired power plants from Calpine Corporation for $739 million. The two Denver-area plants have a generating capacity of more than 900 MW and were already providing power to Public Service Company of Colorado under a contract agreement. The company is planning to acquire 775 MW of new wind-power capacity for its Colorado system over the next several years. \u2013 less",

            "description": "Ameren provides the power that makes much of the American Midwest run. The holding company distributes electricity to 2.4 million customers and natural gas to 900,000 customers in Missouri and Illinois through utility subsidiaries. Ameren has a generating capacity of 16,000 MW (primarily coal-fired), most of which is controlled by utility Union Electric (which does business as Ameren Missouri) and nonregulated subsidiary AmerenEnergy Resources Generating Company. Ameren, which also supplies merchant generation power to third parties, operates a nuclear power facility, three hydroelectric plants, and several coal-fired plants and turbine combustion facilities. It also purchases power, including windpower.\n\nOperations\n\nIn addition to operating power plants, Ameren procures natural gas for its affiliated companies, builds new power plants, and provides long-term energy supply contracts. It also markets and trades electricity to wholesale and retail customers and provides risk management and other energy-related services.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nAmeren's overall revenues dipped in 2011. While increased rates helped to lift Ameren Missouri's revenues in 2011, Ameren Illinois' regulated segment and the merchant generation segment both reported a drop in revenues. In particular, low gas prices and a warm winter hurt gas revenues. However, lower purchased power and resale gas, coupled with a drop in goodwill, impairment, and other charges, helped to lift Ameren's net income for the year.\n\nFavorable weather conditions (which increased energy demand) and rate increases help to lift the company's revenues in 2010. However, impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets in the merchant generation segment (due to the sustained decline in market prices for electricity) dragged down Ameren's operating income.\n\nStrategy\n\nIn 2010 the company combined AmerenIP, AmerenCIPS, and AmerenCILCO into one entity, Ameren Illinois, in order to streamline operations and reduce confusion among customers. The three Illinois utilities have operated as a single business since 2004 and deliver energy to more than 1,100 communities. Ameren Illinois also operates some 21,400 miles of natural gas distribution and transmission lines.\n\nTo comply with federal requirements to separate ownership of power generation and transmission businesses, the operations of Ameren subsidiaries' transmission assets are under the control ofMidwest Independent Transmission System Operator, a regional transmission organization that coordinates power across 15 Midwestern states and one Canadian Province.  \u2013 less",

            "description": "Celanese Corporation gets a lot of good ink about its acetates. The company's primary operations include the manufacture of building block chemicals like acetic acid and vinyl acetate monomers. Those chemicals are used in everything from inks and paints to agricultural products and chewing gum. Canadian subsidiary Acetex, the majority of whose sales come from Europe, is the world's largest acetyls manufacturer. Other products include acetate tow (in cigarette filters); industrial specialties like ethylene vinyl aceta; and engineered plastics. The bulk of sales come from the US and Germany. \n\nOperations\n\nCelanese operates through four business segments: Advanced Engineered Materials, Consumer Specialties, Industrial Specialties, and Acetyl Intermediates. The company is one of the world's largest producers of acetyl products, as well as a top global producer of engineered polymers.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nIn addition to manufacturing sites in the US, it also has properties, plants, and equipment in Belgium, China, Canada, Germany, Mexico, and Singapore.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nCelanese continued its recovery from the recession of 2008-09 with a 14% increase in revenues in 2011, due primarily to higher volumes and increased sales prices across most of its business segments. The largest gains were in its Industrial Specialties unit (up 18%), Advanced Engineered Materials unit (up 17%), and its Acetyl Intermediates segment (up 15%). Net income grew by 61% in 2011, as increased revenues outpaced a more modest growth in operating expenses.\n\nStrategy\n\nCelanese's strategy is to grow the company through expansion into emerging regions, particularly China; to offer innovation through developing new products and applications; increase its productivity through energy reduction, business process improvements, and manufacturing optimization; and boost its portfolio by growing its business through both acquisitions or internal growth.\n\nIn 2012 the company teamed up with Indonesia's Pertamina, forming a joint venture to develop fuel ethanol projects in that country.\n\nTo grow its emulsion polymers business, in 2011 the company acquired two product lines, Vinac and Flexbond, from Ashland. The acquisition is expected to speed up growth of the company's emulsion polymers operations throughout the Americas -- especially in the adhesives, textiles, coatings, and paper segments.\n\nCelanese subsidiary Ticona Engineering Polymers acquired two product lines, Zenite liquid crystal polymer and Thermx polycyclohexylene-dimethylene terephthalate, from DuPont Performance Polymers division in 2010. The units expanded Celanese's offerings in the electrical and electronics application segments of the global polymers market. \n\nOwnership\n\nIn 2012 Capital Research Global Investors owned about 11% of Celanese, with several other investment firms owning a smaller stakes.\n\nCompany Background\n\nCelanese Corporation was created in 2004 by the Blackstone Group, which had acquired a majority share in Celanese AG, turned it private, and then flipped it in a 2005 public offering. Blackstone finally divested its remaining holdings in Celanese in 2007. \u2013 less",

Through its Foodservice division, PFG supplies more than 68,000 products to independent restaurants, hotels, other hospitality operators, and healthcare facilities through some 20 distribution facilities. The PFG Customized distribution unit serves chain restaurants such as Cracker Barrel and Ruby Tuesday. PFG subsidiary Vistar is a distributor of candy, snacks, and convenience foods for vending operators, retailers, and concessions. The company is owned by The Blackstone Group and Wellspring Capital Management, which took the business private in 2008.\n\nOperations\n\nWith the $1.3 billion buyout in 2008 PFG was merged with Colorado-based Vistar (which was already controlled by Blackstone) to create a giant in the foodservice distribution industry with tentacles reaching into several markets. The combined business continues to operate under the PFG name, although each unit maintains its own headquarters. Across the company's foodservice, Vistar, and customized distribution businesses PFG collectively delivers more than 98,000 national- and proprietary-branded food and food-related products to more than 128,000 customers. As part of its operations, PFG maintains about 70 distribution centers and more than a dozen Merchant's Mart locations in the US.\n\nStrategy\n\nFor PFG's broadline Performance Foodservice division, the focus has been on building the range of products it distributes to existing customers while improving margins. The division's more than 41,000 customers, located in about 40 countries, include franchisees of such chains as Burger King, Popeyes (owned by AFC Enterprises), and Subway. It also serves contract foodservice operators, such as Compass Group North America.\n\nMergers and Acquisitions\n\nThe company moved to expand its broadline division in mid-2012 by acquiring Carolina-based rival Institution Food House from Alex Lee. It also entered into an agreement in late 2012 to buy independent broadline foodservice distributor Fox River Foods, which serves seven states primarily in the Upper Midwestern region. The deals followed PFG's purchase in 2010 of Ledyard Company, which serves central and northern California. To add breadth to its product offering at its New England and Ohio offices, PFG in 2010 bought out the assets of VME Distributors. The wholesale supplier catered to mobile caterers, office coffee services, schools, prisons, and vending operators that do business in New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. \u2013 less",

Duke Energy Carolinas also sells power to wholesale customers.\n\nThe utility's three nuclear plants account for more than a quarter of Duke Energy Carolinas' generating capacity.\n\nDuke Energy Carolinas is investing $7 billion from 2010 to 2012 to expand its generating capacity and maintain its nuclear fuel and plants. By 2020 the company is looking to expand capacity by 5,400 MW, a strategy that brings new plants online while replacing older, less efficient ones.\n\nThe global recession produced weaker demand for power (especially from industrial customers) which lowered company revenues in 2009. However, the same downturn cut fuel expenses (including purchased power from third parties) resulting in only a slight dip in Duke Energy Carolinas' operating income.\n\nIn 2010 the company saw its revenues rise, primarily due to new retail electric base rates in North Carolina and South Carolina, and favorable weather conditions which spurred demand. Duke Energy Carolinas also posted higher net income, despite an increase in fuel costs and expenses related to an employee voluntary severance plan. \u2013 less",

The company's primary operations include the manufacture of building block chemicals like acetic acid and vinyl acetate monomers. Those chemicals are used in everything from inks and paints to agricultural products and chewing gum. Canadian subsidiary Acetex, the majority of whose sales come from Europe, is the world's largest acetyls manufacturer. Other products include acetate tow (in cigarette filters); industrial specialties like ethylene vinyl aceta; and engineered plastics. The bulk of sales come from the US and Germany. \n\nOperations\n\nCelanese operates through four business segments: Advanced Engineered Materials, Consumer Specialties, Industrial Specialties, and Acetyl Intermediates. The company is one of the world's largest producers of acetyl products, as well as a top global producer of engineered polymers.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nIn addition to manufacturing sites in the US, it also has properties, plants, and equipment in Belgium, China, Canada, Germany, Mexico, and Singapore.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nCelanese continued its recovery from the recession of 2008-09 with a 14% increase in revenues in 2011, due primarily to higher volumes and increased sales prices across most of its business segments. The largest gains were in its Industrial Specialties unit (up 18%), Advanced Engineered Materials unit (up 17%), and its Acetyl Intermediates segment (up 15%). Net income grew by 61% in 2011, as increased revenues outpaced a more modest growth in operating expenses.\n\nStrategy\n\nCelanese's strategy is to grow the company through expansion into emerging regions, particularly China; to offer innovation through developing new products and applications; increase its productivity through energy reduction, business process improvements, and manufacturing optimization; and boost its portfolio by growing its business through both acquisitions or internal growth.\n\nIn 2012 the company teamed up with Indonesia's Pertamina, forming a joint venture to develop fuel ethanol projects in that country.\n\nTo grow its emulsion polymers business, in 2011 the company acquired two product lines, Vinac and Flexbond, from Ashland. The acquisition is expected to speed up growth of the company's emulsion polymers operations throughout the Americas -- especially in the adhesives, textiles, coatings, and paper segments.\n\nCelanese subsidiary Ticona Engineering Polymers acquired two product lines, Zenite liquid crystal polymer and Thermx polycyclohexylene-dimethylene terephthalate, from DuPont Performance Polymers division in 2010. The units expanded Celanese's offerings in the electrical and electronics application segments of the global polymers market. \n\nOwnership\n\nIn 2012 Capital Research Global Investors owned about 11% of Celanese, with several other investment firms owning a smaller stakes.\n\nCompany Background\n\nCelanese Corporation was created in 2004 by the Blackstone Group, which had acquired a majority share in Celanese AG, turned it private, and then flipped it in a 2005 public offering. Blackstone finally divested its remaining holdings in Celanese in 2007. \u2013 less",

            "description": "No stranger to speed, O. Bruton Smith has raced Sonic Automotive to the front of the pack of US auto dealers behind larger rivals, such as AutoNation and Penske Automotive. Founded with five dealerships in 1997, Sonic today owns about 120 new- and used-vehicle dealerships and about 25 collision repair centers in major markets in 15 states, including Texas, the Carolinas, Tennessee and Georgia. The company sells some 30 brands of cars and light trucks and offers vehicle financing. Chairman Smith, who runs Sonic Automotive with his son Scott, is also the majority owner of Speedway Motorsports, which operates more than half a dozen NASCAR auto racetracks.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nOverall, the company's revenues in 2011 accounted for some $7.8 billion versus around $3.6 billion in 2010. Net income came in at $77.6 million in 2011 compared to $95.9 million in 2010, a 15% decrease. In 2011 the impact of earthquakes and the tsunami that struck Japan disrupted the company's Japanese supply chain and vehicle production. Sonic's new vehicle revenues and gross margins were impacted, thus affecting net income. Sonics' new vehicle sales generated around $4.3 million (about 55% of revenues) in revenues in 2011; used vehicle sales accounted for some $2 million (around 25% of revenues), and the company's parts, service and collision segment accounted for around $1.2 million (some 15% of revenues) in revenues.\n\nOperations\n\nIn 2011 the company sold approximately 12.7 million new vehicles compared to 11.6 million vehicles sold in 2010, a year-over-year increase of some 10%. The company sells new vehicles, including luxury (BMW, Lexus, Land Rover, and Volvo), mid-line import (Honda, Nissan, and Toyota), and domestic brands (Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors). Its luxury brands generated some 50% of revenues in 2011; while the company's mid-line and domestic brands accounted for about 35% and 15%, respectively.\n\nStrategy\n\nAs part of the company's strategic plans, Sonic is primarily focused in growing its operations in metropolitan markets in the Southeast, Southwest, Midwest, and the West (California). The company's long-term growth strategy is to target luxury or mid-line import brands.\n\nOwnership\n\nThe Smiths control the company through their ownership of about 75% of Sonic Automotive's voting stock. \u2013 less",

Operating in a 24,000-square mile service territory, Duke Energy Carolinas has 101,400 miles of distribution cable. Its transmission system spans 13,100 miles. The utility has a net generating capacity of about 19,200 MW from interests in fossil-fueled, nuclear, and hydroelectric power plants. Duke Energy Carolinas also sells power to wholesale customers.\n\nThe utility's three nuclear plants account for more than a quarter of Duke Energy Carolinas' generating capacity.\n\nDuke Energy Carolinas is investing $7 billion from 2010 to 2012 to expand its generating capacity and maintain its nuclear fuel and plants. By 2020 the company is looking to expand capacity by 5,400 MW, a strategy that brings new plants online while replacing older, less efficient ones.\n\nThe global recession produced weaker demand for power (especially from industrial customers) which lowered company revenues in 2009. However, the same downturn cut fuel expenses (including purchased power from third parties) resulting in only a slight dip in Duke Energy Carolinas' operating income.\n\nIn 2010 the company saw its revenues rise, primarily due to new retail electric base rates in North Carolina and South Carolina, and favorable weather conditions which spurred demand. Duke Energy Carolinas also posted higher net income, despite an increase in fuel costs and expenses related to an employee voluntary severance plan. \u2013 less",

The holding company distributes electricity to 2.4 million customers and natural gas to 900,000 customers in Missouri and Illinois through utility subsidiaries. Ameren has a generating capacity of 16,000 MW (primarily coal-fired), most of which is controlled by utility Union Electric (which does business as Ameren Missouri) and nonregulated subsidiary AmerenEnergy Resources Generating Company. Ameren, which also supplies merchant generation power to third parties, operates a nuclear power facility, three hydroelectric plants, and several coal-fired plants and turbine combustion facilities. It also purchases power, including windpower.\n\nOperations\n\nIn addition to operating power plants, Ameren procures natural gas for its affiliated companies, builds new power plants, and provides long-term energy supply contracts. It also markets and trades electricity to wholesale and retail customers and provides risk management and other energy-related services.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nAmeren's overall revenues dipped in 2011. While increased rates helped to lift Ameren Missouri's revenues in 2011, Ameren Illinois' regulated segment and the merchant generation segment both reported a drop in revenues. In particular, low gas prices and a warm winter hurt gas revenues. However, lower purchased power and resale gas, coupled with a drop in goodwill, impairment, and other charges, helped to lift Ameren's net income for the year.\n\nFavorable weather conditions (which increased energy demand) and rate increases help to lift the company's revenues in 2010. However, impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets in the merchant generation segment (due to the sustained decline in market prices for electricity) dragged down Ameren's operating income.\n\nStrategy\n\nIn 2010 the company combined AmerenIP, AmerenCIPS, and AmerenCILCO into one entity, Ameren Illinois, in order to streamline operations and reduce confusion among customers. The three Illinois utilities have operated as a single business since 2004 and deliver energy to more than 1,100 communities. Ameren Illinois also operates some 21,400 miles of natural gas distribution and transmission lines.\n\nTo comply with federal requirements to separate ownership of power generation and transmission businesses, the operations of Ameren subsidiaries' transmission assets are under the control ofMidwest Independent Transmission System Operator, a regional transmission organization that coordinates power across 15 Midwestern states and one Canadian Province.  \u2013 less",

The bank is primarily active in the UK, where it has some 1,700 branches, but also has significant retail and commercial operations in Europe, Africa (it owns more than half of South African bank Absa Group), the Middle East, and the US. Barclays Bank offers standard retail services such as deposit accounts and lending, including Woolwich-brand mortgages. The bank also provides commercial money transfer services, insurance products, the Barclaycard line of credit cards, and financial advisory services. Barclays Bank traces its roots to the late 17th century.\n\nBarclays Bank has been building up its portfolio of global credit card accounts, especially as other financial groups sell off noncore units during the economic recovery. In 2010 the company acquired the Italian credit card accounts of Citigroup in a deal that included some 197,000 card accounts and approximately \u20ac234 million ($320 million) worth of assets. It previously bought Goldfish, the struggling UK credit card unit of Discover Financial Services, for some \u00a346 million ($70 million). In 2011 Barclays acquired Egg UK's credit card portfolio, which added more than 1 million accounts; it has agreed to buy more Citibank card accounts.\n\nThe bank has also been offloading some of its own holdings as part of an overall corporate restructuring. In 2010 Barclays sold its US subprime loan servicing business, HomEq Servicing, to Ocwen Financial. It also announced plans to abandon retail banking in certain international markets and instead focus on wholesale and commercial banking. In 2011 it shuttered its Indonesian retail unit Bank Akita, which it had acquired only two years before. The company also sold its Russian retail and commercial operations to a group of investors, citing difficulties competing in the market. Barclays will instead focus on its investment banking activities in the region.\n\nIn 2010 Barclays acquired Standard Life Bank from Standard Life for \u00a3226 million ($369 million). The deal added Standard Life's savings and mortgage books to the Barclays fold. Also as part of the deal, Barclays and Standard Life entered into a partnership whereby Barclays markets pension products to its clients.\n\nDespite challenges in the economy, especially in regards to Europe's debt problems, Barclays Bank's revenues grew 8% in 2011. Its Africa business performed relatively strongly, with credit impairments improving, as did Barclaycard, thanks to the portfolio acquisitions which delivered profits. That year the bank closed nearly 150 European branches (largely located in Spain), the costs of which contributed to a 5% decline in net income. \u2013 less",

As the primary operating subsidiary of Pacific Mutual Holding Company, Pacific Life offers a wide range of life insurance, asset management, and financial services products, including individual annuities and mutual funds. It also offers a variety of investment products and services for individuals, businesses, and pension plans. Subsidiary Pacific Life & Annuity offers the same mix of life insurance and investment products and services for individuals and businesses in New York. Pacific Life was founded in 1868.\n\nOperations\n\nPacific Life policyholders are members of parent Pacific Mutual Holding Company, which was created in 1997 following a conversion to the mutual holding company structure. Pacific LifeCorp is the intermediate stock holding company.\n\nWhile life insurance is the company's bread and butter, it has brought in other operations for variety. Pacific Life's Aviation Capital Group subsidiary leases commercial jets to 90 airlines in more than 40 countries. It also manages aircraft assets for third parties such as commercial airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and financial institutions. Other subsidiaries include Pacific Asset Management, which provides third-party institutional asset management.\n\nSales & Marketing\n\nPacific Life's insurance policies are sold through independent distributors and through dealer/broker subsidiary Pacific Select Distributors.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nThe company's growth strategies helped Pacific Life achieve strong results in 2011, with revenues increasing 15% over 2010 to almost 6.7 billion, and net income increasing 29% to $679 million. Its operating income climbed a whopping 40% over 2010 to reach $823 million. The gains achieved were attributed to enhanced service offerings, expanded life insurance, annuity, and mutual fund product offerings, and the two acquisitions made that year.\n\nStrategy\n\nBeing a mutual company, Pacific Life operates with a long-term focus to serve in the best interests of its policyholders and clients. in doing so, the company navigated the chilly economic waters of the 2008-2009 recession by steadily introducing new products and building up its capital reserves. By 2010 its net income had grown as risk-weary customers squirreled more of their savings and retirement monies into life insurance and mutual funds.\n\nMergers, Acquisitions & Divestitures\n\nIn 2008 the company added international reinsurance to its portfolio when it acquired the former London-based specialty reinsurance operations of Scottish Re and renamed the business as Pacific Life Re. It then added life retrocession (reinsurance of a reinsurer) to its line-up in 2011 by acquiring that business from Manulife and expanded its business to include the Toronto, Boston, Barbados, and Cologne markets.\n\nAlso in 2011 Pacific life bought JPMorgan Chase's pension risk advisory business to form Pacific Global Advisors. The unit offers risk management solutions and advisory services to pension plan sponsors.\n\nThe firm divested a noncore business, College Savings Bank, in 2012 to a syndicate of investors for an undisclosed price. The banking unit managed two state-sponsored 529 college savings plans. \u2013 less",

            "description": "When it comes to data storage, Western Digital has drive. The company is one of the largest independent makers of hard-disk drives, which record, store, and recall volumes of data. Drives for PCs account for most of Western Digital's sales, although the company also makes devices used in servers, cloud computing data centers, and home entertainment products such as set-top boxes and video game consoles. The company sells to manufacturers and through retailers and distributors. More than 60% of its sales are to OEMs such as  Hewlett-Packard, which is Western Digital's largest customer. The company gets more than half of its sales from the Asia/Pacific region.\n\nOperations\n\nWestern Digital is structured around two subsidiaries: WD Technologies and Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST). Each subsidiary maintains its own brand and product lines, with separate sales, marketing, operations, and product development teams. The company is looking to offer improved customer experiences for competing and complementary brands, while finding efficiencies in shared services.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nThe company is seeing strong growth in Asia (which represents more than 55% of sales) and the US (nearly 20%), with slower growth in the EMEA region (another nearly 20%). Western Digital has manufacturing facilities in the US and across Asia and sales offices worldwide.\n\nStrategy\n\nWestern Digital is one of a handful of manufacturers that dominate the hard-disk drive market -- a sector characterized by harsh competition, short product life cycles, and aggressive price cuts. In order to reduce its dependence on drives for PCs, the company has branched into branded consumer media devices, including DVR expanders, portable media drives, and media players that let users play data from external drives on TV. Its WD TV Live Plus media player streams movies (including those offered by Netflix) and Internet video to a digital TV. It is also investing in products for the mobile computing and cloud computing markets.\n\nAnother promising market for Western Digital is nearline hard drives, which are more cost effective than traditional hard drives by providing more capacity while requiring lower power. Nearline hard drives are used for stimulated applications, such as video surveillance and medical imaging, and IT infrastructure applications, including scientific computing and Web search engines.\n\nMergers & Acquisitions\n\nIn 2012 Western Digital bought Hitachi's disk drive business, HGST, for around $4.3 billion in cash and stock. The deal boosts Western Digital's share of the global market to nearly 50%, ahead of rival Seagate Technology which accounts for around 30% of global shipments. Strategically, the deal adds disk drives used with servers -- a large part of both Hitachi and Seagate's businesses -- and gives Western Digital a better foothold in solid-state drives used in tablets and other portable devices. The acquisition also provides Western Digital its first manufacturing foothold in China and the Philippines. With the stock portion of the sale, Hitachi gains a 10% stake in Western Digital and two spots on the board of directors.\n\nWestern Digital has long used acquisitions to add new product lines and extend its geographic reach. Over the past several years it bought the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya for about $233 million and entered the market for solid-state drives with the $65 million purchase of SiliconSystems. In a large 2007 acquisition, Western Digital bought disk component maker Komag for $1 billion, which gave it the ability to manufacture the media and substrates used in its drives.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nWestern Digital's sales have fluctuated in recent years as it has dealt with the worldwide economic downturn. However, its acquisition of HGST helped produce strong results for fiscal 2012 (ended June 30). The company's revenues grew 31% that year to $12.5 billion, with HGST contributing more than $3 billion of that. It also saw an improvement in hard drive average selling price from $45 in fiscal 2011 to $62 in fiscal 2012.\n\nAlthough Western Digital saw increased R&D and SG&A expenses in 2012, the overall strength of revenues led to a 122% jump in net income (to $1.6 billion). \u2013 less",

            "description": "Xcel Energy has accelerated its energy engine in utility markets across the US. The utility holding company distributes electricity to 3.4 million customers and natural gas to 1.9 million in eight states through four regulated utilities; Colorado and Minnesota account for most of its customers. Its utilities -- Northern States Power (NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin), Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service (in New Mexico and Texas) -- have the combined capacity of more than 17,150 MW of electricity. Xcel owns transmission and distribution lines, as well as natural gas assets. It is also the top wind power provider in the US, with wind farms in Colorado, Minnesota, and Texas.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nThe company serves customers in Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin.\n\n \n\nOperations\n\nXcel operates power and gas utilities: Northern States Power, Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service. The holding company has more than 80 generating plants, more than 87,750 miles of transmission lines and about 191,840 miles of distribution lines. It also operates an interstate natural gas pipeline company and a joint venture to develop and lease natural gas pipelines, storage, and compression assets.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nIn 2011 Xcel reported a 3% jump in sales due to an increase in demand caused by a warmer-than-normal summer and a colder-than-normal winter. It was also assisted by a 3.7% increase in the electric segment due to cost recovery of the acquisition of the Rocky Mountain and Blue Spruce natural gas facilities by Public Service Company of Colorado and by natural gas retail rate increases in Minnesota.\n\nNet income rose by 11% thanks to higher revenues and lower electric fuel and purchased power costs.\n\nHigher rates and increased weather-related demand helped sales in 2010 to rise nearly 7%, going from $9.6 billion to about $10.3 billion. \n\nStrategy\n\nXcel is an energy company in transition, with long-term plans to move from coal-fired plants to natural gas, and on to alternative fuels such as wind, solar, and biomass to boost its green  power capacity (88,705 MWh by 2015).\n\nIn 2012 the company was seeking proposals for renewable resources other than wind or solar as part of its plan to diversify Southwestern Public Service Company  renewable energy portfolio.\n\nAs the largest US utility wind energy provider, Xcel controlled some 3,500 MW of wind energy in its portfolio in 2011 and plans to have 7,400 MW by 2020. In 2011 Xcel bought the 200 MW Limon Wind Energy Center, which will have 125 turbines in Lincoln and Elbert counties on Colorado's Front Range east of Denver. The company is also the US's fifth-largest utility solar energy provider and owns the fourth-largest transmission system. In addition, Xcel operates more than 25 hydroelectric power plants in Colorado, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.\n\nThe company believes its strategy of making environmentally sound investments is pivotal to its success. Among its 2010 projects were launching its 800-MW coal-fired unit in Colorado, known as Comanche 3, after installing advanced emission-reduction equipment. It also began construction of its CapX2020 project, a joint venture transmission expansion project with 10 other utilities, scheduled for completion by 2020. The project includes a 240-mile transmission line from Minnesota to North Dakota. The company has filed to extend the licensing plants of its two nuclear plants on Prairie Island in Minnesota for 20 years, which it expects to save customers more than $1 billion compared to alternative sources.\n\nXcel plans to construct one of the largest biomass generating plants in the Midwest. The facility, proposed for the Bay Front Generating Station in Ashland, Wisconsin, will generate power from burning wood waste in all three operating units by 2014. In 2011 Xcel had 73 MW of biomass generating power in Minnesota and Wisconsin.\n\nXcel is also working to develop so-called \"smart grid\" technology, which will provide customers with more reliability and control over their energy use. It has completed the nation's first fully integrated SmartGridCity in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nIn 2010 Xcel acquired two gas-fired power plants from Calpine Corporation for $739 million. The two Denver-area plants have a generating capacity of more than 900 MW and were already providing power to Public Service Company of Colorado under a contract agreement. The company is planning to acquire 775 MW of new wind-power capacity for its Colorado system over the next several years. \u2013 less",

The bank is primarily active in the UK, where it has some 1,700 branches, but also has significant retail and commercial operations in Europe, Africa (it owns more than half of South African bank Absa Group), the Middle East, and the US. Barclays Bank offers standard retail services such as deposit accounts and lending, including Woolwich-brand mortgages. The bank also provides commercial money transfer services, insurance products, the Barclaycard line of credit cards, and financial advisory services. Barclays Bank traces its roots to the late 17th century.\n\nBarclays Bank has been building up its portfolio of global credit card accounts, especially as other financial groups sell off noncore units during the economic recovery. In 2010 the company acquired the Italian credit card accounts of Citigroup in a deal that included some 197,000 card accounts and approximately \u20ac234 million ($320 million) worth of assets. It previously bought Goldfish, the struggling UK credit card unit of Discover Financial Services, for some \u00a346 million ($70 million). In 2011 Barclays acquired Egg UK's credit card portfolio, which added more than 1 million accounts; it has agreed to buy more Citibank card accounts.\n\nThe bank has also been offloading some of its own holdings as part of an overall corporate restructuring. In 2010 Barclays sold its US subprime loan servicing business, HomEq Servicing, to Ocwen Financial. It also announced plans to abandon retail banking in certain international markets and instead focus on wholesale and commercial banking. In 2011 it shuttered its Indonesian retail unit Bank Akita, which it had acquired only two years before. The company also sold its Russian retail and commercial operations to a group of investors, citing difficulties competing in the market. Barclays will instead focus on its investment banking activities in the region.\n\nIn 2010 Barclays acquired Standard Life Bank from Standard Life for \u00a3226 million ($369 million). The deal added Standard Life's savings and mortgage books to the Barclays fold. Also as part of the deal, Barclays and Standard Life entered into a partnership whereby Barclays markets pension products to its clients.\n\nDespite challenges in the economy, especially in regards to Europe's debt problems, Barclays Bank's revenues grew 8% in 2011. Its Africa business performed relatively strongly, with credit impairments improving, as did Barclaycard, thanks to the portfolio acquisitions which delivered profits. That year the bank closed nearly 150 European branches (largely located in Spain), the costs of which contributed to a 5% decline in net income. \u2013 less",

Bruton Smith has raced Sonic Automotive to the front of the pack of US auto dealers behind larger rivals, such as AutoNation and Penske Automotive. Founded with five dealerships in 1997, Sonic today owns about 120 new- and used-vehicle dealerships and about 25 collision repair centers in major markets in 15 states, including Texas, the Carolinas, Tennessee and Georgia. The company sells some 30 brands of cars and light trucks and offers vehicle financing. Chairman Smith, who runs Sonic Automotive with his son Scott, is also the majority owner of Speedway Motorsports, which operates more than half a dozen NASCAR auto racetracks.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nOverall, the company's revenues in 2011 accounted for some $7.8 billion versus around $3.6 billion in 2010. Net income came in at $77.6 million in 2011 compared to $95.9 million in 2010, a 15% decrease. In 2011 the impact of earthquakes and the tsunami that struck Japan disrupted the company's Japanese supply chain and vehicle production. Sonic's new vehicle revenues and gross margins were impacted, thus affecting net income. Sonics' new vehicle sales generated around $4.3 million (about 55% of revenues) in revenues in 2011; used vehicle sales accounted for some $2 million (around 25% of revenues), and the company's parts, service and collision segment accounted for around $1.2 million (some 15% of revenues) in revenues.\n\nOperations\n\nIn 2011 the company sold approximately 12.7 million new vehicles compared to 11.6 million vehicles sold in 2010, a year-over-year increase of some 10%. The company sells new vehicles, including luxury (BMW, Lexus, Land Rover, and Volvo), mid-line import (Honda, Nissan, and Toyota), and domestic brands (Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors). Its luxury brands generated some 50% of revenues in 2011; while the company's mid-line and domestic brands accounted for about 35% and 15%, respectively.\n\nStrategy\n\nAs part of the company's strategic plans, Sonic is primarily focused in growing its operations in metropolitan markets in the Southeast, Southwest, Midwest, and the West (California). The company's long-term growth strategy is to target luxury or mid-line import brands.\n\nOwnership\n\nThe Smiths control the company through their ownership of about 75% of Sonic Automotive's voting stock. \u2013 less",

            "description": "DCP Midstream Partners is the publicly traded entity of DCP Midstream LLC, one of the largest natural gas gatherers in North America and also the top producer and one of the primary marketers of natural gas liquids (NGLs). It also engages in natural gas compressing, treating, processing, transporting, and selling. DCP Midstream LLC also transports and sells NGLs and distributes propane wholesale. The company operates natural gas gathering systems (5,300 miles of pipe) in eight states (including Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas), seven processing plants, four NGL pipelines, and nine propane storage terminals. Spectra Energy holds a 50% holding in DCP (ConocoPhillips holds the other 50%).\n\nA consolidator in the fragmented natural gas gathering, NGLs, and wholesale propane industry segments, the company has been expanding its gas supply base and its propane wholesale network in recent years through strategic complementary acquisitions and joint ventures.\n\nIn 2012 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Texas-based Crossroads processing plant and gathering system from Penn Virginia Resource Partners for $63 million. The bolt-on acquisition allows the company to expand its market position in East Texas and provide services to drillers in the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley regions.\n\nIn 2011 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Seaway Products Pipeline Co. from ConocoPhillips. The pipeline, now called Southern Hills Pipeline and being converted to NGL service, is expected to be operational by mid-2013. It will provide NGL access from the Midcontinent to the Texas Gulf Coast.\n\nThe company agreed to form a joint venture with EQT Corporation to develop natural gas processing and related natural gas liquid (NGL) infrastructure in the Marcellus and Huron shale plays in the Appalachian basin. (However, the parties could not come to agreement and dropped the plan in early 2011). In 2010, the company acquired the Liberty gathering system and south Raywood processing plant from Ceritas Energy in southeast Texas. The pipeline system interconnects with DCP Midstream's Centana Intrastate Pipeline system.\n\nExpanding in Michigan, in 2009 the company acquired gas gathering and treating assets for $45.1 million. In 2010 it acquired a 350-mile interstate natural gas liquids pipeline system in Colorado's Denver-Julesburg Basin from Buckeye Partners for $22 million.\n\nIn 2010 DCP Midstream Partners moved to extend its Northeast wholesale propane business into the MidAtlantic region, acquiring UGI's Atlantic Energy for $49 million. That year it also purchased of NGL storage company Marysville Hydrocarbon Holdings (in Michigan) for about $95 million.\n\nAlthough DCP Midstream Partners' revenues suffered in 2009 as a result of the global recession and lower commodity prices, acquisitions and organic growth managed to offset lower natural gas volumes.  Acquisitions, increased demand, higher commodity and propane prices, and gains on derivatives help to lift the company's revenues and net income in 2010.\n\nIn terms of the company's origins, the D in DCP Midstream Partners (formerly Duke Energy Field Services) is for Duke Energy; the CP, ConocoPhillips. These two energy majors formed DCP Midstream Partners in 2005. Following the spinoff of Spectra Energy from Duke Energy in 2007, Spectra Energy assumed Duke Energy's 50% holding in DCP. \u2013 less",

            "description": "When it comes to data storage, Western Digital has drive. The company is one of the largest independent makers of hard-disk drives, which record, store, and recall volumes of data. Drives for PCs account for most of Western Digital's sales, although the company also makes devices used in servers, cloud computing data centers, and home entertainment products such as set-top boxes and video game consoles. The company sells to manufacturers and through retailers and distributors. More than 60% of its sales are to OEMs such as  Hewlett-Packard, which is Western Digital's largest customer. The company gets more than half of its sales from the Asia/Pacific region.\n\nOperations\n\nWestern Digital is structured around two subsidiaries: WD Technologies and Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST). Each subsidiary maintains its own brand and product lines, with separate sales, marketing, operations, and product development teams. The company is looking to offer improved customer experiences for competing and complementary brands, while finding efficiencies in shared services.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nThe company is seeing strong growth in Asia (which represents more than 55% of sales) and the US (nearly 20%), with slower growth in the EMEA region (another nearly 20%). Western Digital has manufacturing facilities in the US and across Asia and sales offices worldwide.\n\nStrategy\n\nWestern Digital is one of a handful of manufacturers that dominate the hard-disk drive market -- a sector characterized by harsh competition, short product life cycles, and aggressive price cuts. In order to reduce its dependence on drives for PCs, the company has branched into branded consumer media devices, including DVR expanders, portable media drives, and media players that let users play data from external drives on TV. Its WD TV Live Plus media player streams movies (including those offered by Netflix) and Internet video to a digital TV. It is also investing in products for the mobile computing and cloud computing markets.\n\nAnother promising market for Western Digital is nearline hard drives, which are more cost effective than traditional hard drives by providing more capacity while requiring lower power. Nearline hard drives are used for stimulated applications, such as video surveillance and medical imaging, and IT infrastructure applications, including scientific computing and Web search engines.\n\nMergers & Acquisitions\n\nIn 2012 Western Digital bought Hitachi's disk drive business, HGST, for around $4.3 billion in cash and stock. The deal boosts Western Digital's share of the global market to nearly 50%, ahead of rival Seagate Technology which accounts for around 30% of global shipments. Strategically, the deal adds disk drives used with servers -- a large part of both Hitachi and Seagate's businesses -- and gives Western Digital a better foothold in solid-state drives used in tablets and other portable devices. The acquisition also provides Western Digital its first manufacturing foothold in China and the Philippines. With the stock portion of the sale, Hitachi gains a 10% stake in Western Digital and two spots on the board of directors.\n\nWestern Digital has long used acquisitions to add new product lines and extend its geographic reach. Over the past several years it bought the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya for about $233 million and entered the market for solid-state drives with the $65 million purchase of SiliconSystems. In a large 2007 acquisition, Western Digital bought disk component maker Komag for $1 billion, which gave it the ability to manufacture the media and substrates used in its drives.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nWestern Digital's sales have fluctuated in recent years as it has dealt with the worldwide economic downturn. However, its acquisition of HGST helped produce strong results for fiscal 2012 (ended June 30). The company's revenues grew 31% that year to $12.5 billion, with HGST contributing more than $3 billion of that. It also saw an improvement in hard drive average selling price from $45 in fiscal 2011 to $62 in fiscal 2012.\n\nAlthough Western Digital saw increased R&D and SG&A expenses in 2012, the overall strength of revenues led to a 122% jump in net income (to $1.6 billion). \u2013 less",

            "description": "While the breaching whale logo used by Pacific Life Insurance evokes the West Coast, the company operates all across the US. As the primary operating subsidiary of Pacific Mutual Holding Company, Pacific Life offers a wide range of life insurance, asset management, and financial services products, including individual annuities and mutual funds. It also offers a variety of investment products and services for individuals, businesses, and pension plans. Subsidiary Pacific Life & Annuity offers the same mix of life insurance and investment products and services for individuals and businesses in New York. Pacific Life was founded in 1868.\n\nOperations\n\nPacific Life policyholders are members of parent Pacific Mutual Holding Company, which was created in 1997 following a conversion to the mutual holding company structure. Pacific LifeCorp is the intermediate stock holding company.\n\nWhile life insurance is the company's bread and butter, it has brought in other operations for variety. Pacific Life's Aviation Capital Group subsidiary leases commercial jets to 90 airlines in more than 40 countries. It also manages aircraft assets for third parties such as commercial airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and financial institutions. Other subsidiaries include Pacific Asset Management, which provides third-party institutional asset management.\n\nSales & Marketing\n\nPacific Life's insurance policies are sold through independent distributors and through dealer/broker subsidiary Pacific Select Distributors.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nThe company's growth strategies helped Pacific Life achieve strong results in 2011, with revenues increasing 15% over 2010 to almost 6.7 billion, and net income increasing 29% to $679 million. Its operating income climbed a whopping 40% over 2010 to reach $823 million. The gains achieved were attributed to enhanced service offerings, expanded life insurance, annuity, and mutual fund product offerings, and the two acquisitions made that year.\n\nStrategy\n\nBeing a mutual company, Pacific Life operates with a long-term focus to serve in the best interests of its policyholders and clients. in doing so, the company navigated the chilly economic waters of the 2008-2009 recession by steadily introducing new products and building up its capital reserves. By 2010 its net income had grown as risk-weary customers squirreled more of their savings and retirement monies into life insurance and mutual funds.\n\nMergers, Acquisitions & Divestitures\n\nIn 2008 the company added international reinsurance to its portfolio when it acquired the former London-based specialty reinsurance operations of Scottish Re and renamed the business as Pacific Life Re. It then added life retrocession (reinsurance of a reinsurer) to its line-up in 2011 by acquiring that business from Manulife and expanded its business to include the Toronto, Boston, Barbados, and Cologne markets.\n\nAlso in 2011 Pacific life bought JPMorgan Chase's pension risk advisory business to form Pacific Global Advisors. The unit offers risk management solutions and advisory services to pension plan sponsors.\n\nThe firm divested a noncore business, College Savings Bank, in 2012 to a syndicate of investors for an undisclosed price. The banking unit managed two state-sponsored 529 college savings plans. \u2013 less",

            "description": "When it comes to data storage, Western Digital has drive. The company is one of the largest independent makers of hard-disk drives, which record, store, and recall volumes of data. Drives for PCs account for most of Western Digital's sales, although the company also makes devices used in servers, cloud computing data centers, and home entertainment products such as set-top boxes and video game consoles. The company sells to manufacturers and through retailers and distributors. More than 60% of its sales are to OEMs such as  Hewlett-Packard, which is Western Digital's largest customer. The company gets more than half of its sales from the Asia/Pacific region.\n\nOperations\n\nWestern Digital is structured around two subsidiaries: WD Technologies and Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST). Each subsidiary maintains its own brand and product lines, with separate sales, marketing, operations, and product development teams. The company is looking to offer improved customer experiences for competing and complementary brands, while finding efficiencies in shared services.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nThe company is seeing strong growth in Asia (which represents more than 55% of sales) and the US (nearly 20%), with slower growth in the EMEA region (another nearly 20%). Western Digital has manufacturing facilities in the US and across Asia and sales offices worldwide.\n\nStrategy\n\nWestern Digital is one of a handful of manufacturers that dominate the hard-disk drive market -- a sector characterized by harsh competition, short product life cycles, and aggressive price cuts. In order to reduce its dependence on drives for PCs, the company has branched into branded consumer media devices, including DVR expanders, portable media drives, and media players that let users play data from external drives on TV. Its WD TV Live Plus media player streams movies (including those offered by Netflix) and Internet video to a digital TV. It is also investing in products for the mobile computing and cloud computing markets.\n\nAnother promising market for Western Digital is nearline hard drives, which are more cost effective than traditional hard drives by providing more capacity while requiring lower power. Nearline hard drives are used for stimulated applications, such as video surveillance and medical imaging, and IT infrastructure applications, including scientific computing and Web search engines.\n\nMergers & Acquisitions\n\nIn 2012 Western Digital bought Hitachi's disk drive business, HGST, for around $4.3 billion in cash and stock. The deal boosts Western Digital's share of the global market to nearly 50%, ahead of rival Seagate Technology which accounts for around 30% of global shipments. Strategically, the deal adds disk drives used with servers -- a large part of both Hitachi and Seagate's businesses -- and gives Western Digital a better foothold in solid-state drives used in tablets and other portable devices. The acquisition also provides Western Digital its first manufacturing foothold in China and the Philippines. With the stock portion of the sale, Hitachi gains a 10% stake in Western Digital and two spots on the board of directors.\n\nWestern Digital has long used acquisitions to add new product lines and extend its geographic reach. Over the past several years it bought the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya for about $233 million and entered the market for solid-state drives with the $65 million purchase of SiliconSystems. In a large 2007 acquisition, Western Digital bought disk component maker Komag for $1 billion, which gave it the ability to manufacture the media and substrates used in its drives.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nWestern Digital's sales have fluctuated in recent years as it has dealt with the worldwide economic downturn. However, its acquisition of HGST helped produce strong results for fiscal 2012 (ended June 30). The company's revenues grew 31% that year to $12.5 billion, with HGST contributing more than $3 billion of that. It also saw an improvement in hard drive average selling price from $45 in fiscal 2011 to $62 in fiscal 2012.\n\nAlthough Western Digital saw increased R&D and SG&A expenses in 2012, the overall strength of revenues led to a 122% jump in net income (to $1.6 billion). \u2013 less",

            "description": "Independent oil and gas producer Devon Energy puts its energy into oil and gas fields far from England's southwestern coast, in North America. It focuses on exploration and production assets in Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming, and western Canada. In 2011 Devon Energy reported proved reserves of 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent (58% natural gas) and more than 19,900 net acres of assets. It also drilled almost 2,500 gross wells. Devon Energy produces about 2.5 billion cu. ft. of natural gas a day (more than 3% of all the gas consumed in North America). The company is the largest producer and lease holder in the Barnett Shale (Texas) and is looking to replicate its success there to other unconventional plays.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nOnce active in major oil patches worldwide such as Azerbaijan, Brazil, and China, in the mid-2000s the company decided to focus on safer and increasingly productive unconventional onshore exploration opportunities (shales and oil sands) in North America. As a result, Devon Energy has sold all of its international assets.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nDevon Energy posted a major improvement in revenues in 2010, thanks to higher commodity prices and an increase in production. In 2011, buoyed by record level reserves, high oil prices, and an increased demand for oil and gas products, the company posted a further 15% growth in revenues. Net income only rose by 3%, however, as higher operating, depreciation, deletion, and amortization costs and an increase in deferred income tax expense trimmed income growth.\n\nBoosting its financial resources, in 2012 Devon Energy secured a commitment from Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration & Production for the Chinese company to invest $2.2 billion in exchange for one-third of Devon's interest in five new joint venture plays in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, Niobrara, Mississippian, Ohio Utica Shale, and the Michigan Basin.\n\nThat year it also closed a similar $1.4 billion joint venture deal with Sumitomo Corp. to develop 650,000 net acres in the Cline Shale and the Midland-Wolfcamp Shale in West Texas.\n\nStrategy\n\nIn 2010 it sold most of its remaining international assets to BP for $7 billion. As part of this deal BP sold undeveloped oil sand leases in Canada to Devon Energy for $500 million and formed a joint venture with the company to exploit them. The company also sold its Panyu field, offshore China, to China National Offshore Oil for $515 million.\n\nConsolidating its North American assets to just its onshore properties, In 2010 Devon Energy sold its stakes in the Cascade, Jack and St. Malo fields in the Gulf of Mexico (about 200 million barrels of estimated recoverable reserves) to AP Moller-Maersk's oil unit for $1.3 billion. It also sold its remaining Gulf of Mexico shelf assets to Apache for $1 billion. \u2013 less",

As the primary operating subsidiary of Pacific Mutual Holding Company, Pacific Life offers a wide range of life insurance, asset management, and financial services products, including individual annuities and mutual funds. It also offers a variety of investment products and services for individuals, businesses, and pension plans. Subsidiary Pacific Life & Annuity offers the same mix of life insurance and investment products and services for individuals and businesses in New York. Pacific Life was founded in 1868.\n\nOperations\n\nPacific Life policyholders are members of parent Pacific Mutual Holding Company, which was created in 1997 following a conversion to the mutual holding company structure. Pacific LifeCorp is the intermediate stock holding company.\n\nWhile life insurance is the company's bread and butter, it has brought in other operations for variety. Pacific Life's Aviation Capital Group subsidiary leases commercial jets to 90 airlines in more than 40 countries. It also manages aircraft assets for third parties such as commercial airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and financial institutions. Other subsidiaries include Pacific Asset Management, which provides third-party institutional asset management.\n\nSales & Marketing\n\nPacific Life's insurance policies are sold through independent distributors and through dealer/broker subsidiary Pacific Select Distributors.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nThe company's growth strategies helped Pacific Life achieve strong results in 2011, with revenues increasing 15% over 2010 to almost 6.7 billion, and net income increasing 29% to $679 million. Its operating income climbed a whopping 40% over 2010 to reach $823 million. The gains achieved were attributed to enhanced service offerings, expanded life insurance, annuity, and mutual fund product offerings, and the two acquisitions made that year.\n\nStrategy\n\nBeing a mutual company, Pacific Life operates with a long-term focus to serve in the best interests of its policyholders and clients. in doing so, the company navigated the chilly economic waters of the 2008-2009 recession by steadily introducing new products and building up its capital reserves. By 2010 its net income had grown as risk-weary customers squirreled more of their savings and retirement monies into life insurance and mutual funds.\n\nMergers, Acquisitions & Divestitures\n\nIn 2008 the company added international reinsurance to its portfolio when it acquired the former London-based specialty reinsurance operations of Scottish Re and renamed the business as Pacific Life Re. It then added life retrocession (reinsurance of a reinsurer) to its line-up in 2011 by acquiring that business from Manulife and expanded its business to include the Toronto, Boston, Barbados, and Cologne markets.\n\nAlso in 2011 Pacific life bought JPMorgan Chase's pension risk advisory business to form Pacific Global Advisors. The unit offers risk management solutions and advisory services to pension plan sponsors.\n\nThe firm divested a noncore business, College Savings Bank, in 2012 to a syndicate of investors for an undisclosed price. The banking unit managed two state-sponsored 529 college savings plans. \u2013 less",

            "description": "It's no surprise that Ameriprise Financial is a leading provider of financial advice. The company offers financial planning, products, and services to individual and institutional investors. Through Ameriprise Financial, Columbia Management, RiverSource, and other affiliates and brands, the company provides access to insurance, mutual funds, savings plans, personal trust services, retail brokerage, and other financial products and services. Its Ameriprise Bank subsidiary offers deposits and loans. Ameriprise, which has about $630 billion of assets under management, distributes its products primarily through a network of more than 9,700 financial advisors.\n\nThe company has been sharpening its focus on its branded adviser network. It sold its Securities America independent broker-dealer subsidiary to Ladenburg Thalmann for some $150 million in 2011. Shortly before the sale of the troubled unit, Ameriprise agreed to pay $160 million to settle claims that Securities America brokers sold securities in fraudulent companies.\n\nAmeriprise has been steadily boosting its assets under management and growing its client base (focusing on the affluent and mass affluent with at least $100,000 in investable assets). The company also is focused on geographic areas where those clients are congregated and has closed or consolidated offices in areas with less potential. While Columbia Management covers Ameriprise's main asset management market in the US, the company is increasing its global presence through its Threadneedle brand overseas. Ameriprise plans to grow its asset management operations in Europe, as well as in Australia, the Middle East, and Asia.\n\nAmeriprise's strategies have paid off. Volatile financial market conditions, which negatively impacted all of the company's operations, led to a decline in revenue in 2008 and 2009. However, the company returned to success in 2010 and revenues grew by more than 20% that year. Poor economic conditions continued in 2011. However, Ameriprise's operating net revenues climbed that year by about 10%. The boost was due to strong growth in the company's fee-based advisory and asset management businesses.\n\nAmeriprise Financial, which was founded in 1894, was spun off from American Express in 2005. \u2013 less",

The bank is primarily active in the UK, where it has some 1,700 branches, but also has significant retail and commercial operations in Europe, Africa (it owns more than half of South African bank Absa Group), the Middle East, and the US. Barclays Bank offers standard retail services such as deposit accounts and lending, including Woolwich-brand mortgages. The bank also provides commercial money transfer services, insurance products, the Barclaycard line of credit cards, and financial advisory services. Barclays Bank traces its roots to the late 17th century.\n\nBarclays Bank has been building up its portfolio of global credit card accounts, especially as other financial groups sell off noncore units during the economic recovery. In 2010 the company acquired the Italian credit card accounts of Citigroup in a deal that included some 197,000 card accounts and approximately \u20ac234 million ($320 million) worth of assets. It previously bought Goldfish, the struggling UK credit card unit of Discover Financial Services, for some \u00a346 million ($70 million). In 2011 Barclays acquired Egg UK's credit card portfolio, which added more than 1 million accounts; it has agreed to buy more Citibank card accounts.\n\nThe bank has also been offloading some of its own holdings as part of an overall corporate restructuring. In 2010 Barclays sold its US subprime loan servicing business, HomEq Servicing, to Ocwen Financial. It also announced plans to abandon retail banking in certain international markets and instead focus on wholesale and commercial banking. In 2011 it shuttered its Indonesian retail unit Bank Akita, which it had acquired only two years before. The company also sold its Russian retail and commercial operations to a group of investors, citing difficulties competing in the market. Barclays will instead focus on its investment banking activities in the region.\n\nIn 2010 Barclays acquired Standard Life Bank from Standard Life for \u00a3226 million ($369 million). The deal added Standard Life's savings and mortgage books to the Barclays fold. Also as part of the deal, Barclays and Standard Life entered into a partnership whereby Barclays markets pension products to its clients.\n\nDespite challenges in the economy, especially in regards to Europe's debt problems, Barclays Bank's revenues grew 8% in 2011. Its Africa business performed relatively strongly, with credit impairments improving, as did Barclaycard, thanks to the portfolio acquisitions which delivered profits. That year the bank closed nearly 150 European branches (largely located in Spain), the costs of which contributed to a 5% decline in net income. \u2013 less",

Bruton Smith has raced Sonic Automotive to the front of the pack of US auto dealers behind larger rivals, such as AutoNation and Penske Automotive. Founded with five dealerships in 1997, Sonic today owns about 120 new- and used-vehicle dealerships and about 25 collision repair centers in major markets in 15 states, including Texas, the Carolinas, Tennessee and Georgia. The company sells some 30 brands of cars and light trucks and offers vehicle financing. Chairman Smith, who runs Sonic Automotive with his son Scott, is also the majority owner of Speedway Motorsports, which operates more than half a dozen NASCAR auto racetracks.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nOverall, the company's revenues in 2011 accounted for some $7.8 billion versus around $3.6 billion in 2010. Net income came in at $77.6 million in 2011 compared to $95.9 million in 2010, a 15% decrease. In 2011 the impact of earthquakes and the tsunami that struck Japan disrupted the company's Japanese supply chain and vehicle production. Sonic's new vehicle revenues and gross margins were impacted, thus affecting net income. Sonics' new vehicle sales generated around $4.3 million (about 55% of revenues) in revenues in 2011; used vehicle sales accounted for some $2 million (around 25% of revenues), and the company's parts, service and collision segment accounted for around $1.2 million (some 15% of revenues) in revenues.\n\nOperations\n\nIn 2011 the company sold approximately 12.7 million new vehicles compared to 11.6 million vehicles sold in 2010, a year-over-year increase of some 10%. The company sells new vehicles, including luxury (BMW, Lexus, Land Rover, and Volvo), mid-line import (Honda, Nissan, and Toyota), and domestic brands (Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors). Its luxury brands generated some 50% of revenues in 2011; while the company's mid-line and domestic brands accounted for about 35% and 15%, respectively.\n\nStrategy\n\nAs part of the company's strategic plans, Sonic is primarily focused in growing its operations in metropolitan markets in the Southeast, Southwest, Midwest, and the West (California). The company's long-term growth strategy is to target luxury or mid-line import brands.\n\nOwnership\n\nThe Smiths control the company through their ownership of about 75% of Sonic Automotive's voting stock. \u2013 less",

            "description": "Barclays Bank is the flagship subsidiary of global financial group Barclays PLC. The bank is primarily active in the UK, where it has some 1,700 branches, but also has significant retail and commercial operations in Europe, Africa (it owns more than half of South African bank Absa Group), the Middle East, and the US. Barclays Bank offers standard retail services such as deposit accounts and lending, including Woolwich-brand mortgages. The bank also provides commercial money transfer services, insurance products, the Barclaycard line of credit cards, and financial advisory services. Barclays Bank traces its roots to the late 17th century.\n\nBarclays Bank has been building up its portfolio of global credit card accounts, especially as other financial groups sell off noncore units during the economic recovery. In 2010 the company acquired the Italian credit card accounts of Citigroup in a deal that included some 197,000 card accounts and approximately \u20ac234 million ($320 million) worth of assets. It previously bought Goldfish, the struggling UK credit card unit of Discover Financial Services, for some \u00a346 million ($70 million). In 2011 Barclays acquired Egg UK's credit card portfolio, which added more than 1 million accounts; it has agreed to buy more Citibank card accounts.\n\nThe bank has also been offloading some of its own holdings as part of an overall corporate restructuring. In 2010 Barclays sold its US subprime loan servicing business, HomEq Servicing, to Ocwen Financial. It also announced plans to abandon retail banking in certain international markets and instead focus on wholesale and commercial banking. In 2011 it shuttered its Indonesian retail unit Bank Akita, which it had acquired only two years before. The company also sold its Russian retail and commercial operations to a group of investors, citing difficulties competing in the market. Barclays will instead focus on its investment banking activities in the region.\n\nIn 2010 Barclays acquired Standard Life Bank from Standard Life for \u00a3226 million ($369 million). The deal added Standard Life's savings and mortgage books to the Barclays fold. Also as part of the deal, Barclays and Standard Life entered into a partnership whereby Barclays markets pension products to its clients.\n\nDespite challenges in the economy, especially in regards to Europe's debt problems, Barclays Bank's revenues grew 8% in 2011. Its Africa business performed relatively strongly, with credit impairments improving, as did Barclaycard, thanks to the portfolio acquisitions which delivered profits. That year the bank closed nearly 150 European branches (largely located in Spain), the costs of which contributed to a 5% decline in net income. \u2013 less",

The utility has a net generating capacity of about 19,200 MW from interests in fossil-fueled, nuclear, and hydroelectric power plants. Duke Energy Carolinas also sells power to wholesale customers.\n\nThe utility's three nuclear plants account for more than a quarter of Duke Energy Carolinas' generating capacity.\n\nDuke Energy Carolinas is investing $7 billion from 2010 to 2012 to expand its generating capacity and maintain its nuclear fuel and plants. By 2020 the company is looking to expand capacity by 5,400 MW, a strategy that brings new plants online while replacing older, less efficient ones.\n\nThe global recession produced weaker demand for power (especially from industrial customers) which lowered company revenues in 2009. However, the same downturn cut fuel expenses (including purchased power from third parties) resulting in only a slight dip in Duke Energy Carolinas' operating income.\n\nIn 2010 the company saw its revenues rise, primarily due to new retail electric base rates in North Carolina and South Carolina, and favorable weather conditions which spurred demand. Duke Energy Carolinas also posted higher net income, despite an increase in fuel costs and expenses related to an employee voluntary severance plan. \u2013 less",

Bruton Smith has raced Sonic Automotive to the front of the pack of US auto dealers behind larger rivals, such as AutoNation and Penske Automotive. Founded with five dealerships in 1997, Sonic today owns about 120 new- and used-vehicle dealerships and about 25 collision repair centers in major markets in 15 states, including Texas, the Carolinas, Tennessee and Georgia. The company sells some 30 brands of cars and light trucks and offers vehicle financing. Chairman Smith, who runs Sonic Automotive with his son Scott, is also the majority owner of Speedway Motorsports, which operates more than half a dozen NASCAR auto racetracks.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nOverall, the company's revenues in 2011 accounted for some $7.8 billion versus around $3.6 billion in 2010. Net income came in at $77.6 million in 2011 compared to $95.9 million in 2010, a 15% decrease. In 2011 the impact of earthquakes and the tsunami that struck Japan disrupted the company's Japanese supply chain and vehicle production. Sonic's new vehicle revenues and gross margins were impacted, thus affecting net income. Sonics' new vehicle sales generated around $4.3 million (about 55% of revenues) in revenues in 2011; used vehicle sales accounted for some $2 million (around 25% of revenues), and the company's parts, service and collision segment accounted for around $1.2 million (some 15% of revenues) in revenues.\n\nOperations\n\nIn 2011 the company sold approximately 12.7 million new vehicles compared to 11.6 million vehicles sold in 2010, a year-over-year increase of some 10%. The company sells new vehicles, including luxury (BMW, Lexus, Land Rover, and Volvo), mid-line import (Honda, Nissan, and Toyota), and domestic brands (Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors). Its luxury brands generated some 50% of revenues in 2011; while the company's mid-line and domestic brands accounted for about 35% and 15%, respectively.\n\nStrategy\n\nAs part of the company's strategic plans, Sonic is primarily focused in growing its operations in metropolitan markets in the Southeast, Southwest, Midwest, and the West (California). The company's long-term growth strategy is to target luxury or mid-line import brands.\n\nOwnership\n\nThe Smiths control the company through their ownership of about 75% of Sonic Automotive's voting stock. \u2013 less",

            "description": "Independent oil and gas producer Devon Energy puts its energy into oil and gas fields far from England's southwestern coast, in North America. It focuses on exploration and production assets in Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming, and western Canada. In 2011 Devon Energy reported proved reserves of 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent (58% natural gas) and more than 19,900 net acres of assets. It also drilled almost 2,500 gross wells. Devon Energy produces about 2.5 billion cu. ft. of natural gas a day (more than 3% of all the gas consumed in North America). The company is the largest producer and lease holder in the Barnett Shale (Texas) and is looking to replicate its success there to other unconventional plays.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nOnce active in major oil patches worldwide such as Azerbaijan, Brazil, and China, in the mid-2000s the company decided to focus on safer and increasingly productive unconventional onshore exploration opportunities (shales and oil sands) in North America. As a result, Devon Energy has sold all of its international assets.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nDevon Energy posted a major improvement in revenues in 2010, thanks to higher commodity prices and an increase in production. In 2011, buoyed by record level reserves, high oil prices, and an increased demand for oil and gas products, the company posted a further 15% growth in revenues. Net income only rose by 3%, however, as higher operating, depreciation, deletion, and amortization costs and an increase in deferred income tax expense trimmed income growth.\n\nBoosting its financial resources, in 2012 Devon Energy secured a commitment from Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration & Production for the Chinese company to invest $2.2 billion in exchange for one-third of Devon's interest in five new joint venture plays in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, Niobrara, Mississippian, Ohio Utica Shale, and the Michigan Basin.\n\nThat year it also closed a similar $1.4 billion joint venture deal with Sumitomo Corp. to develop 650,000 net acres in the Cline Shale and the Midland-Wolfcamp Shale in West Texas.\n\nStrategy\n\nIn 2010 it sold most of its remaining international assets to BP for $7 billion. As part of this deal BP sold undeveloped oil sand leases in Canada to Devon Energy for $500 million and formed a joint venture with the company to exploit them. The company also sold its Panyu field, offshore China, to China National Offshore Oil for $515 million.\n\nConsolidating its North American assets to just its onshore properties, In 2010 Devon Energy sold its stakes in the Cascade, Jack and St. Malo fields in the Gulf of Mexico (about 200 million barrels of estimated recoverable reserves) to AP Moller-Maersk's oil unit for $1.3 billion. It also sold its remaining Gulf of Mexico shelf assets to Apache for $1 billion. \u2013 less",

            "description": "DCP Midstream Partners is the publicly traded entity of DCP Midstream LLC, one of the largest natural gas gatherers in North America and also the top producer and one of the primary marketers of natural gas liquids (NGLs). It also engages in natural gas compressing, treating, processing, transporting, and selling. DCP Midstream LLC also transports and sells NGLs and distributes propane wholesale. The company operates natural gas gathering systems (5,300 miles of pipe) in eight states (including Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas), seven processing plants, four NGL pipelines, and nine propane storage terminals. Spectra Energy holds a 50% holding in DCP (ConocoPhillips holds the other 50%).\n\nA consolidator in the fragmented natural gas gathering, NGLs, and wholesale propane industry segments, the company has been expanding its gas supply base and its propane wholesale network in recent years through strategic complementary acquisitions and joint ventures.\n\nIn 2012 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Texas-based Crossroads processing plant and gathering system from Penn Virginia Resource Partners for $63 million. The bolt-on acquisition allows the company to expand its market position in East Texas and provide services to drillers in the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley regions.\n\nIn 2011 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Seaway Products Pipeline Co. from ConocoPhillips. The pipeline, now called Southern Hills Pipeline and being converted to NGL service, is expected to be operational by mid-2013. It will provide NGL access from the Midcontinent to the Texas Gulf Coast.\n\nThe company agreed to form a joint venture with EQT Corporation to develop natural gas processing and related natural gas liquid (NGL) infrastructure in the Marcellus and Huron shale plays in the Appalachian basin. (However, the parties could not come to agreement and dropped the plan in early 2011). In 2010, the company acquired the Liberty gathering system and south Raywood processing plant from Ceritas Energy in southeast Texas. The pipeline system interconnects with DCP Midstream's Centana Intrastate Pipeline system.\n\nExpanding in Michigan, in 2009 the company acquired gas gathering and treating assets for $45.1 million. In 2010 it acquired a 350-mile interstate natural gas liquids pipeline system in Colorado's Denver-Julesburg Basin from Buckeye Partners for $22 million.\n\nIn 2010 DCP Midstream Partners moved to extend its Northeast wholesale propane business into the MidAtlantic region, acquiring UGI's Atlantic Energy for $49 million. That year it also purchased of NGL storage company Marysville Hydrocarbon Holdings (in Michigan) for about $95 million.\n\nAlthough DCP Midstream Partners' revenues suffered in 2009 as a result of the global recession and lower commodity prices, acquisitions and organic growth managed to offset lower natural gas volumes.  Acquisitions, increased demand, higher commodity and propane prices, and gains on derivatives help to lift the company's revenues and net income in 2010.\n\nIn terms of the company's origins, the D in DCP Midstream Partners (formerly Duke Energy Field Services) is for Duke Energy; the CP, ConocoPhillips. These two energy majors formed DCP Midstream Partners in 2005. Following the spinoff of Spectra Energy from Duke Energy in 2007, Spectra Energy assumed Duke Energy's 50% holding in DCP. \u2013 less",

            "description": "Xcel Energy has accelerated its energy engine in utility markets across the US. The utility holding company distributes electricity to 3.4 million customers and natural gas to 1.9 million in eight states through four regulated utilities; Colorado and Minnesota account for most of its customers. Its utilities -- Northern States Power (NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin), Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service (in New Mexico and Texas) -- have the combined capacity of more than 17,150 MW of electricity. Xcel owns transmission and distribution lines, as well as natural gas assets. It is also the top wind power provider in the US, with wind farms in Colorado, Minnesota, and Texas.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nThe company serves customers in Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin.\n\n \n\nOperations\n\nXcel operates power and gas utilities: Northern States Power, Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service. The holding company has more than 80 generating plants, more than 87,750 miles of transmission lines and about 191,840 miles of distribution lines. It also operates an interstate natural gas pipeline company and a joint venture to develop and lease natural gas pipelines, storage, and compression assets.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nIn 2011 Xcel reported a 3% jump in sales due to an increase in demand caused by a warmer-than-normal summer and a colder-than-normal winter. It was also assisted by a 3.7% increase in the electric segment due to cost recovery of the acquisition of the Rocky Mountain and Blue Spruce natural gas facilities by Public Service Company of Colorado and by natural gas retail rate increases in Minnesota.\n\nNet income rose by 11% thanks to higher revenues and lower electric fuel and purchased power costs.\n\nHigher rates and increased weather-related demand helped sales in 2010 to rise nearly 7%, going from $9.6 billion to about $10.3 billion. \n\nStrategy\n\nXcel is an energy company in transition, with long-term plans to move from coal-fired plants to natural gas, and on to alternative fuels such as wind, solar, and biomass to boost its green  power capacity (88,705 MWh by 2015).\n\nIn 2012 the company was seeking proposals for renewable resources other than wind or solar as part of its plan to diversify Southwestern Public Service Company  renewable energy portfolio.\n\nAs the largest US utility wind energy provider, Xcel controlled some 3,500 MW of wind energy in its portfolio in 2011 and plans to have 7,400 MW by 2020. In 2011 Xcel bought the 200 MW Limon Wind Energy Center, which will have 125 turbines in Lincoln and Elbert counties on Colorado's Front Range east of Denver. The company is also the US's fifth-largest utility solar energy provider and owns the fourth-largest transmission system. In addition, Xcel operates more than 25 hydroelectric power plants in Colorado, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.\n\nThe company believes its strategy of making environmentally sound investments is pivotal to its success. Among its 2010 projects were launching its 800-MW coal-fired unit in Colorado, known as Comanche 3, after installing advanced emission-reduction equipment. It also began construction of its CapX2020 project, a joint venture transmission expansion project with 10 other utilities, scheduled for completion by 2020. The project includes a 240-mile transmission line from Minnesota to North Dakota. The company has filed to extend the licensing plants of its two nuclear plants on Prairie Island in Minnesota for 20 years, which it expects to save customers more than $1 billion compared to alternative sources.\n\nXcel plans to construct one of the largest biomass generating plants in the Midwest. The facility, proposed for the Bay Front Generating Station in Ashland, Wisconsin, will generate power from burning wood waste in all three operating units by 2014. In 2011 Xcel had 73 MW of biomass generating power in Minnesota and Wisconsin.\n\nXcel is also working to develop so-called \"smart grid\" technology, which will provide customers with more reliability and control over their energy use. It has completed the nation's first fully integrated SmartGridCity in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nIn 2010 Xcel acquired two gas-fired power plants from Calpine Corporation for $739 million. The two Denver-area plants have a generating capacity of more than 900 MW and were already providing power to Public Service Company of Colorado under a contract agreement. The company is planning to acquire 775 MW of new wind-power capacity for its Colorado system over the next several years. \u2013 less",

            "description": "Xcel Energy has accelerated its energy engine in utility markets across the US. The utility holding company distributes electricity to 3.4 million customers and natural gas to 1.9 million in eight states through four regulated utilities; Colorado and Minnesota account for most of its customers. Its utilities -- Northern States Power (NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin), Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service (in New Mexico and Texas) -- have the combined capacity of more than 17,150 MW of electricity. Xcel owns transmission and distribution lines, as well as natural gas assets. It is also the top wind power provider in the US, with wind farms in Colorado, Minnesota, and Texas.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nThe company serves customers in Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin.\n\n \n\nOperations\n\nXcel operates power and gas utilities: Northern States Power, Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service. The holding company has more than 80 generating plants, more than 87,750 miles of transmission lines and about 191,840 miles of distribution lines. It also operates an interstate natural gas pipeline company and a joint venture to develop and lease natural gas pipelines, storage, and compression assets.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nIn 2011 Xcel reported a 3% jump in sales due to an increase in demand caused by a warmer-than-normal summer and a colder-than-normal winter. It was also assisted by a 3.7% increase in the electric segment due to cost recovery of the acquisition of the Rocky Mountain and Blue Spruce natural gas facilities by Public Service Company of Colorado and by natural gas retail rate increases in Minnesota.\n\nNet income rose by 11% thanks to higher revenues and lower electric fuel and purchased power costs.\n\nHigher rates and increased weather-related demand helped sales in 2010 to rise nearly 7%, going from $9.6 billion to about $10.3 billion. \n\nStrategy\n\nXcel is an energy company in transition, with long-term plans to move from coal-fired plants to natural gas, and on to alternative fuels such as wind, solar, and biomass to boost its green  power capacity (88,705 MWh by 2015).\n\nIn 2012 the company was seeking proposals for renewable resources other than wind or solar as part of its plan to diversify Southwestern Public Service Company  renewable energy portfolio.\n\nAs the largest US utility wind energy provider, Xcel controlled some 3,500 MW of wind energy in its portfolio in 2011 and plans to have 7,400 MW by 2020. In 2011 Xcel bought the 200 MW Limon Wind Energy Center, which will have 125 turbines in Lincoln and Elbert counties on Colorado's Front Range east of Denver. The company is also the US's fifth-largest utility solar energy provider and owns the fourth-largest transmission system. In addition, Xcel operates more than 25 hydroelectric power plants in Colorado, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.\n\nThe company believes its strategy of making environmentally sound investments is pivotal to its success. Among its 2010 projects were launching its 800-MW coal-fired unit in Colorado, known as Comanche 3, after installing advanced emission-reduction equipment. It also began construction of its CapX2020 project, a joint venture transmission expansion project with 10 other utilities, scheduled for completion by 2020. The project includes a 240-mile transmission line from Minnesota to North Dakota. The company has filed to extend the licensing plants of its two nuclear plants on Prairie Island in Minnesota for 20 years, which it expects to save customers more than $1 billion compared to alternative sources.\n\nXcel plans to construct one of the largest biomass generating plants in the Midwest. The facility, proposed for the Bay Front Generating Station in Ashland, Wisconsin, will generate power from burning wood waste in all three operating units by 2014. In 2011 Xcel had 73 MW of biomass generating power in Minnesota and Wisconsin.\n\nXcel is also working to develop so-called \"smart grid\" technology, which will provide customers with more reliability and control over their energy use. It has completed the nation's first fully integrated SmartGridCity in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nIn 2010 Xcel acquired two gas-fired power plants from Calpine Corporation for $739 million. The two Denver-area plants have a generating capacity of more than 900 MW and were already providing power to Public Service Company of Colorado under a contract agreement. The company is planning to acquire 775 MW of new wind-power capacity for its Colorado system over the next several years. \u2013 less",

            "description": "When it comes to data storage, Western Digital has drive. The company is one of the largest independent makers of hard-disk drives, which record, store, and recall volumes of data. Drives for PCs account for most of Western Digital's sales, although the company also makes devices used in servers, cloud computing data centers, and home entertainment products such as set-top boxes and video game consoles. The company sells to manufacturers and through retailers and distributors. More than 60% of its sales are to OEMs such as  Hewlett-Packard, which is Western Digital's largest customer. The company gets more than half of its sales from the Asia/Pacific region.\n\nOperations\n\nWestern Digital is structured around two subsidiaries: WD Technologies and Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST). Each subsidiary maintains its own brand and product lines, with separate sales, marketing, operations, and product development teams. The company is looking to offer improved customer experiences for competing and complementary brands, while finding efficiencies in shared services.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nThe company is seeing strong growth in Asia (which represents more than 55% of sales) and the US (nearly 20%), with slower growth in the EMEA region (another nearly 20%). Western Digital has manufacturing facilities in the US and across Asia and sales offices worldwide.\n\nStrategy\n\nWestern Digital is one of a handful of manufacturers that dominate the hard-disk drive market -- a sector characterized by harsh competition, short product life cycles, and aggressive price cuts. In order to reduce its dependence on drives for PCs, the company has branched into branded consumer media devices, including DVR expanders, portable media drives, and media players that let users play data from external drives on TV. Its WD TV Live Plus media player streams movies (including those offered by Netflix) and Internet video to a digital TV. It is also investing in products for the mobile computing and cloud computing markets.\n\nAnother promising market for Western Digital is nearline hard drives, which are more cost effective than traditional hard drives by providing more capacity while requiring lower power. Nearline hard drives are used for stimulated applications, such as video surveillance and medical imaging, and IT infrastructure applications, including scientific computing and Web search engines.\n\nMergers & Acquisitions\n\nIn 2012 Western Digital bought Hitachi's disk drive business, HGST, for around $4.3 billion in cash and stock. The deal boosts Western Digital's share of the global market to nearly 50%, ahead of rival Seagate Technology which accounts for around 30% of global shipments. Strategically, the deal adds disk drives used with servers -- a large part of both Hitachi and Seagate's businesses -- and gives Western Digital a better foothold in solid-state drives used in tablets and other portable devices. The acquisition also provides Western Digital its first manufacturing foothold in China and the Philippines. With the stock portion of the sale, Hitachi gains a 10% stake in Western Digital and two spots on the board of directors.\n\nWestern Digital has long used acquisitions to add new product lines and extend its geographic reach. Over the past several years it bought the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya for about $233 million and entered the market for solid-state drives with the $65 million purchase of SiliconSystems. In a large 2007 acquisition, Western Digital bought disk component maker Komag for $1 billion, which gave it the ability to manufacture the media and substrates used in its drives.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nWestern Digital's sales have fluctuated in recent years as it has dealt with the worldwide economic downturn. However, its acquisition of HGST helped produce strong results for fiscal 2012 (ended June 30). The company's revenues grew 31% that year to $12.5 billion, with HGST contributing more than $3 billion of that. It also saw an improvement in hard drive average selling price from $45 in fiscal 2011 to $62 in fiscal 2012.\n\nAlthough Western Digital saw increased R&D and SG&A expenses in 2012, the overall strength of revenues led to a 122% jump in net income (to $1.6 billion). \u2013 less",

            "description": "DCP Midstream Partners is the publicly traded entity of DCP Midstream LLC, one of the largest natural gas gatherers in North America and also the top producer and one of the primary marketers of natural gas liquids (NGLs). It also engages in natural gas compressing, treating, processing, transporting, and selling. DCP Midstream LLC also transports and sells NGLs and distributes propane wholesale. The company operates natural gas gathering systems (5,300 miles of pipe) in eight states (including Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas), seven processing plants, four NGL pipelines, and nine propane storage terminals. Spectra Energy holds a 50% holding in DCP (ConocoPhillips holds the other 50%).\n\nA consolidator in the fragmented natural gas gathering, NGLs, and wholesale propane industry segments, the company has been expanding its gas supply base and its propane wholesale network in recent years through strategic complementary acquisitions and joint ventures.\n\nIn 2012 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Texas-based Crossroads processing plant and gathering system from Penn Virginia Resource Partners for $63 million. The bolt-on acquisition allows the company to expand its market position in East Texas and provide services to drillers in the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley regions.\n\nIn 2011 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Seaway Products Pipeline Co. from ConocoPhillips. The pipeline, now called Southern Hills Pipeline and being converted to NGL service, is expected to be operational by mid-2013. It will provide NGL access from the Midcontinent to the Texas Gulf Coast.\n\nThe company agreed to form a joint venture with EQT Corporation to develop natural gas processing and related natural gas liquid (NGL) infrastructure in the Marcellus and Huron shale plays in the Appalachian basin. (However, the parties could not come to agreement and dropped the plan in early 2011). In 2010, the company acquired the Liberty gathering system and south Raywood processing plant from Ceritas Energy in southeast Texas. The pipeline system interconnects with DCP Midstream's Centana Intrastate Pipeline system.\n\nExpanding in Michigan, in 2009 the company acquired gas gathering and treating assets for $45.1 million. In 2010 it acquired a 350-mile interstate natural gas liquids pipeline system in Colorado's Denver-Julesburg Basin from Buckeye Partners for $22 million.\n\nIn 2010 DCP Midstream Partners moved to extend its Northeast wholesale propane business into the MidAtlantic region, acquiring UGI's Atlantic Energy for $49 million. That year it also purchased of NGL storage company Marysville Hydrocarbon Holdings (in Michigan) for about $95 million.\n\nAlthough DCP Midstream Partners' revenues suffered in 2009 as a result of the global recession and lower commodity prices, acquisitions and organic growth managed to offset lower natural gas volumes.  Acquisitions, increased demand, higher commodity and propane prices, and gains on derivatives help to lift the company's revenues and net income in 2010.\n\nIn terms of the company's origins, the D in DCP Midstream Partners (formerly Duke Energy Field Services) is for Duke Energy; the CP, ConocoPhillips.

CenterPoint Energy's regulated utilities distribute natural gas to 3.3 million customers in six US states and electricity to more than 2 million customers on the Texas Gulf Coast. The company's main stomping ground is Texas, where it has regulated power distribution operations through subsidiary CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric. CenterPoint Energy operates more than 48,230 miles of power distribution lines, 8,000 miles of interstate gas pipeline, and 3,800 miles of gas gathering pipeline. It also provides natural gas field services. \n\nOperations\n\nThe company's natural gas distribution subsidiaries serve customers in Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas. (Texas represented 47% of all natural gas distribution customers in 2010). CenterPoint Energy also markets natural gas and related services to 12,200 commercial, industrial, and wholesale customers located primarily in the eastern US. It also provides HVAC and other energy-related services through its gas division.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nCenterPoint Energy's sales dropped dramatically in 2009 as the global recession prompted a slump in commodity prices which hurt the performance of its different energy segments. A reviving economy in 2010 led to a stronger demand for power and gas (coupled with rate increases and weather-related spikes in consumption) resulting in a overall jump in revenues and net income that year.\n\nStrategy\n\nCenterPoint Energy's strategy is focused on enhancing and expanding existing core operations, while acquiring complementary and synergistic businesses. In 2011 the company acquired Denver-based natural gas marketing firm Asgard Energy, which supplies gas to agricultural, commercial, industrial, and residential customers in five states (Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, and West Virginia). The acquisition fit into CenterPoint's strategy to expand into the Rockies and diversify into residential choice markets.\n\nIn 2012, to add to its midstream assets, CenterPoint Energy Field Services (CEFS), an indirect subsidiary of the company, acquired gathering and processing assets from Prism Gas Systems, a subsidiary of Martin Midstream Partners for $275 million. The assets include Prism's 50% stake in Texas-based Waskom Gas Processing Co. A CEFS subsidiary owns the other 50% stake in Waskom.  \u2013 less",

            "description": "Independent oil and gas producer Devon Energy puts its energy into oil and gas fields far from England's southwestern coast, in North America. It focuses on exploration and production assets in Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming, and western Canada. In 2011 Devon Energy reported proved reserves of 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent (58% natural gas) and more than 19,900 net acres of assets. It also drilled almost 2,500 gross wells. Devon Energy produces about 2.5 billion cu. ft. of natural gas a day (more than 3% of all the gas consumed in North America). The company is the largest producer and lease holder in the Barnett Shale (Texas) and is looking to replicate its success there to other unconventional plays.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nOnce active in major oil patches worldwide such as Azerbaijan, Brazil, and China, in the mid-2000s the company decided to focus on safer and increasingly productive unconventional onshore exploration opportunities (shales and oil sands) in North America. As a result, Devon Energy has sold all of its international assets.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nDevon Energy posted a major improvement in revenues in 2010, thanks to higher commodity prices and an increase in production. In 2011, buoyed by record level reserves, high oil prices, and an increased demand for oil and gas products, the company posted a further 15% growth in revenues. Net income only rose by 3%, however, as higher operating, depreciation, deletion, and amortization costs and an increase in deferred income tax expense trimmed income growth.\n\nBoosting its financial resources, in 2012 Devon Energy secured a commitment from Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration & Production for the Chinese company to invest $2.2 billion in exchange for one-third of Devon's interest in five new joint venture plays in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, Niobrara, Mississippian, Ohio Utica Shale, and the Michigan Basin.\n\nThat year it also closed a similar $1.4 billion joint venture deal with Sumitomo Corp. to develop 650,000 net acres in the Cline Shale and the Midland-Wolfcamp Shale in West Texas.\n\nStrategy\n\nIn 2010 it sold most of its remaining international assets to BP for $7 billion. As part of this deal BP sold undeveloped oil sand leases in Canada to Devon Energy for $500 million and formed a joint venture with the company to exploit them. The company also sold its Panyu field, offshore China, to China National Offshore Oil for $515 million.\n\nConsolidating its North American assets to just its onshore properties, In 2010 Devon Energy sold its stakes in the Cascade, Jack and St. Malo fields in the Gulf of Mexico (about 200 million barrels of estimated recoverable reserves) to AP Moller-Maersk's oil unit for $1.3 billion. It also sold its remaining Gulf of Mexico shelf assets to Apache for $1 billion. \u2013 less",

The company's primary operations include the manufacture of building block chemicals like acetic acid and vinyl acetate monomers. Those chemicals are used in everything from inks and paints to agricultural products and chewing gum. Canadian subsidiary Acetex, the majority of whose sales come from Europe, is the world's largest acetyls manufacturer. Other products include acetate tow (in cigarette filters); industrial specialties like ethylene vinyl aceta; and engineered plastics. The bulk of sales come from the US and Germany. \n\nOperations\n\nCelanese operates through four business segments: Advanced Engineered Materials, Consumer Specialties, Industrial Specialties, and Acetyl Intermediates. The company is one of the world's largest producers of acetyl products, as well as a top global producer of engineered polymers.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nIn addition to manufacturing sites in the US, it also has properties, plants, and equipment in Belgium, China, Canada, Germany, Mexico, and Singapore.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nCelanese continued its recovery from the recession of 2008-09 with a 14% increase in revenues in 2011, due primarily to higher volumes and increased sales prices across most of its business segments. The largest gains were in its Industrial Specialties unit (up 18%), Advanced Engineered Materials unit (up 17%), and its Acetyl Intermediates segment (up 15%). Net income grew by 61% in 2011, as increased revenues outpaced a more modest growth in operating expenses.\n\nStrategy\n\nCelanese's strategy is to grow the company through expansion into emerging regions, particularly China; to offer innovation through developing new products and applications; increase its productivity through energy reduction, business process improvements, and manufacturing optimization; and boost its portfolio by growing its business through both acquisitions or internal growth.\n\nIn 2012 the company teamed up with Indonesia's Pertamina, forming a joint venture to develop fuel ethanol projects in that country.\n\nTo grow its emulsion polymers business, in 2011 the company acquired two product lines, Vinac and Flexbond, from Ashland. The acquisition is expected to speed up growth of the company's emulsion polymers operations throughout the Americas -- especially in the adhesives, textiles, coatings, and paper segments.\n\nCelanese subsidiary Ticona Engineering Polymers acquired two product lines, Zenite liquid crystal polymer and Thermx polycyclohexylene-dimethylene terephthalate, from DuPont Performance Polymers division in 2010. The units expanded Celanese's offerings in the electrical and electronics application segments of the global polymers market. \n\nOwnership\n\nIn 2012 Capital Research Global Investors owned about 11% of Celanese, with several other investment firms owning a smaller stakes.\n\nCompany Background\n\nCelanese Corporation was created in 2004 by the Blackstone Group, which had acquired a majority share in Celanese AG, turned it private, and then flipped it in a 2005 public offering. Blackstone finally divested its remaining holdings in Celanese in 2007. \u2013 less",

The company is one of the world's largest producers of acetyl products, as well as a top global producer of engineered polymers.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nIn addition to manufacturing sites in the US, it also has properties, plants, and equipment in Belgium, China, Canada, Germany, Mexico, and Singapore.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nCelanese continued its recovery from the recession of 2008-09 with a 14% increase in revenues in 2011, due primarily to higher volumes and increased sales prices across most of its business segments. The largest gains were in its Industrial Specialties unit (up 18%), Advanced Engineered Materials unit (up 17%), and its Acetyl Intermediates segment (up 15%). Net income grew by 61% in 2011, as increased revenues outpaced a more modest growth in operating expenses.\n\nStrategy\n\nCelanese's strategy is to grow the company through expansion into emerging regions, particularly China; to offer innovation through developing new products and applications; increase its productivity through energy reduction, business process improvements, and manufacturing optimization; and boost its portfolio by growing its business through both acquisitions or internal growth.\n\nIn 2012 the company teamed up with Indonesia's Pertamina, forming a joint venture to develop fuel ethanol projects in that country.\n\nTo grow its emulsion polymers business, in 2011 the company acquired two product lines, Vinac and Flexbond, from Ashland. The acquisition is expected to speed up growth of the company's emulsion polymers operations throughout the Americas -- especially in the adhesives, textiles, coatings, and paper segments.\n\nCelanese subsidiary Ticona Engineering Polymers acquired two product lines, Zenite liquid crystal polymer and Thermx polycyclohexylene-dimethylene terephthalate, from DuPont Performance Polymers division in 2010. The units expanded Celanese's offerings in the electrical and electronics application segments of the global polymers market. \n\nOwnership\n\nIn 2012 Capital Research Global Investors owned about 11% of Celanese, with several other investment firms owning a smaller stakes.\n\nCompany Background\n\nCelanese Corporation was created in 2004 by the Blackstone Group, which had acquired a majority share in Celanese AG, turned it private, and then flipped it in a 2005 public offering. Blackstone finally divested its remaining holdings in Celanese in 2007. \u2013 less",

The company operates natural gas gathering systems (5,300 miles of pipe) in eight states (including Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas), seven processing plants, four NGL pipelines, and nine propane storage terminals. Spectra Energy holds a 50% holding in DCP (ConocoPhillips holds the other 50%).\n\nA consolidator in the fragmented natural gas gathering, NGLs, and wholesale propane industry segments, the company has been expanding its gas supply base and its propane wholesale network in recent years through strategic complementary acquisitions and joint ventures.\n\nIn 2012 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Texas-based Crossroads processing plant and gathering system from Penn Virginia Resource Partners for $63 million. The bolt-on acquisition allows the company to expand its market position in East Texas and provide services to drillers in the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley regions.\n\nIn 2011 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Seaway Products Pipeline Co. from ConocoPhillips. The pipeline, now called Southern Hills Pipeline and being converted to NGL service, is expected to be operational by mid-2013. It will provide NGL access from the Midcontinent to the Texas Gulf Coast.\n\nThe company agreed to form a joint venture with EQT Corporation to develop natural gas processing and related natural gas liquid (NGL) infrastructure in the Marcellus and Huron shale plays in the Appalachian basin. (However, the parties could not come to agreement and dropped the plan in early 2011). In 2010, the company acquired the Liberty gathering system and south Raywood processing plant from Ceritas Energy in southeast Texas. The pipeline system interconnects with DCP Midstream's Centana Intrastate Pipeline system.\n\nExpanding in Michigan, in 2009 the company acquired gas gathering and treating assets for $45.1 million. In 2010 it acquired a 350-mile interstate natural gas liquids pipeline system in Colorado's Denver-Julesburg Basin from Buckeye Partners for $22 million.\n\nIn 2010 DCP Midstream Partners moved to extend its Northeast wholesale propane business into the MidAtlantic region, acquiring UGI's Atlantic Energy for $49 million. That year it also purchased of NGL storage company Marysville Hydrocarbon Holdings (in Michigan) for about $95 million.\n\nAlthough DCP Midstream Partners' revenues suffered in 2009 as a result of the global recession and lower commodity prices, acquisitions and organic growth managed to offset lower natural gas volumes.  Acquisitions, increased demand, higher commodity and propane prices, and gains on derivatives help to lift the company's revenues and net income in 2010.\n\nIn terms of the company's origins, the D in DCP Midstream Partners (formerly Duke Energy Field Services) is for Duke Energy; the CP, ConocoPhillips. These two energy majors formed DCP Midstream Partners in 2005. Following the spinoff of Spectra Energy from Duke Energy in 2007, Spectra Energy assumed Duke Energy's 50% holding in DCP. \u2013 less",

            "description": "Independent oil and gas producer Devon Energy puts its energy into oil and gas fields far from England's southwestern coast, in North America. It focuses on exploration and production assets in Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming, and western Canada. In 2011 Devon Energy reported proved reserves of 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent (58% natural gas) and more than 19,900 net acres of assets. It also drilled almost 2,500 gross wells. Devon Energy produces about 2.5 billion cu. ft. of natural gas a day (more than 3% of all the gas consumed in North America). The company is the largest producer and lease holder in the Barnett Shale (Texas) and is looking to replicate its success there to other unconventional plays.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nOnce active in major oil patches worldwide such as Azerbaijan, Brazil, and China, in the mid-2000s the company decided to focus on safer and increasingly productive unconventional onshore exploration opportunities (shales and oil sands) in North America. As a result, Devon Energy has sold all of its international assets.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nDevon Energy posted a major improvement in revenues in 2010, thanks to higher commodity prices and an increase in production. In 2011, buoyed by record level reserves, high oil prices, and an increased demand for oil and gas products, the company posted a further 15% growth in revenues. Net income only rose by 3%, however, as higher operating, depreciation, deletion, and amortization costs and an increase in deferred income tax expense trimmed income growth.\n\nBoosting its financial resources, in 2012 Devon Energy secured a commitment from Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration & Production for the Chinese company to invest $2.2 billion in exchange for one-third of Devon's interest in five new joint venture plays in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, Niobrara, Mississippian, Ohio Utica Shale, and the Michigan Basin.\n\nThat year it also closed a similar $1.4 billion joint venture deal with Sumitomo Corp. to develop 650,000 net acres in the Cline Shale and the Midland-Wolfcamp Shale in West Texas.\n\nStrategy\n\nIn 2010 it sold most of its remaining international assets to BP for $7 billion. As part of this deal BP sold undeveloped oil sand leases in Canada to Devon Energy for $500 million and formed a joint venture with the company to exploit them. The company also sold its Panyu field, offshore China, to China National Offshore Oil for $515 million.\n\nConsolidating its North American assets to just its onshore properties, In 2010 Devon Energy sold its stakes in the Cascade, Jack and St. Malo fields in the Gulf of Mexico (about 200 million barrels of estimated recoverable reserves) to AP Moller-Maersk's oil unit for $1.3 billion. It also sold its remaining Gulf of Mexico shelf assets to Apache for $1 billion. \u2013 less",

            "description": "When it comes to data storage, Western Digital has drive. The company is one of the largest independent makers of hard-disk drives, which record, store, and recall volumes of data. Drives for PCs account for most of Western Digital's sales, although the company also makes devices used in servers, cloud computing data centers, and home entertainment products such as set-top boxes and video game consoles. The company sells to manufacturers and through retailers and distributors. More than 60% of its sales are to OEMs such as  Hewlett-Packard, which is Western Digital's largest customer. The company gets more than half of its sales from the Asia/Pacific region.\n\nOperations\n\nWestern Digital is structured around two subsidiaries: WD Technologies and Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST). Each subsidiary maintains its own brand and product lines, with separate sales, marketing, operations, and product development teams. The company is looking to offer improved customer experiences for competing and complementary brands, while finding efficiencies in shared services.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nThe company is seeing strong growth in Asia (which represents more than 55% of sales) and the US (nearly 20%), with slower growth in the EMEA region (another nearly 20%). Western Digital has manufacturing facilities in the US and across Asia and sales offices worldwide.\n\nStrategy\n\nWestern Digital is one of a handful of manufacturers that dominate the hard-disk drive market -- a sector characterized by harsh competition, short product life cycles, and aggressive price cuts. In order to reduce its dependence on drives for PCs, the company has branched into branded consumer media devices, including DVR expanders, portable media drives, and media players that let users play data from external drives on TV. Its WD TV Live Plus media player streams movies (including those offered by Netflix) and Internet video to a digital TV. It is also investing in products for the mobile computing and cloud computing markets.\n\nAnother promising market for Western Digital is nearline hard drives, which are more cost effective than traditional hard drives by providing more capacity while requiring lower power. Nearline hard drives are used for stimulated applications, such as video surveillance and medical imaging, and IT infrastructure applications, including scientific computing and Web search engines.\n\nMergers & Acquisitions\n\nIn 2012 Western Digital bought Hitachi's disk drive business, HGST, for around $4.3 billion in cash and stock. The deal boosts Western Digital's share of the global market to nearly 50%, ahead of rival Seagate Technology which accounts for around 30% of global shipments. Strategically, the deal adds disk drives used with servers -- a large part of both Hitachi and Seagate's businesses -- and gives Western Digital a better foothold in solid-state drives used in tablets and other portable devices. The acquisition also provides Western Digital its first manufacturing foothold in China and the Philippines. With the stock portion of the sale, Hitachi gains a 10% stake in Western Digital and two spots on the board of directors.\n\nWestern Digital has long used acquisitions to add new product lines and extend its geographic reach. Over the past several years it bought the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya for about $233 million and entered the market for solid-state drives with the $65 million purchase of SiliconSystems. In a large 2007 acquisition, Western Digital bought disk component maker Komag for $1 billion, which gave it the ability to manufacture the media and substrates used in its drives.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nWestern Digital's sales have fluctuated in recent years as it has dealt with the worldwide economic downturn. However, its acquisition of HGST helped produce strong results for fiscal 2012 (ended June 30). The company's revenues grew 31% that year to $12.5 billion, with HGST contributing more than $3 billion of that. It also saw an improvement in hard drive average selling price from $45 in fiscal 2011 to $62 in fiscal 2012.\n\nAlthough Western Digital saw increased R&D and SG&A expenses in 2012, the overall strength of revenues led to a 122% jump in net income (to $1.6 billion). \u2013 less",

By 2020 the company is looking to expand capacity by 5,400 MW, a strategy that brings new plants online while replacing older, less efficient ones.\n\nThe global recession produced weaker demand for power (especially from industrial customers) which lowered company revenues in 2009. However, the same downturn cut fuel expenses (including purchased power from third parties) resulting in only a slight dip in Duke Energy Carolinas' operating income.\n\nIn 2010 the company saw its revenues rise, primarily due to new retail electric base rates in North Carolina and South Carolina, and favorable weather conditions which spurred demand. Duke Energy Carolinas also posted higher net income, despite an increase in fuel costs and expenses related to an employee voluntary severance plan. \u2013 less",

It focuses on exploration and production assets in Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming, and western Canada. In 2011 Devon Energy reported proved reserves of 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent (58% natural gas) and more than 19,900 net acres of assets. It also drilled almost 2,500 gross wells. Devon Energy produces about 2.5 billion cu. ft. of natural gas a day (more than 3% of all the gas consumed in North America). The company is the largest producer and lease holder in the Barnett Shale (Texas) and is looking to replicate its success there to other unconventional plays.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nOnce active in major oil patches worldwide such as Azerbaijan, Brazil, and China, in the mid-2000s the company decided to focus on safer and increasingly productive unconventional onshore exploration opportunities (shales and oil sands) in North America. As a result, Devon Energy has sold all of its international assets.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nDevon Energy posted a major improvement in revenues in 2010, thanks to higher commodity prices and an increase in production. In 2011, buoyed by record level reserves, high oil prices, and an increased demand for oil and gas products, the company posted a further 15% growth in revenues. Net income only rose by 3%, however, as higher operating, depreciation, deletion, and amortization costs and an increase in deferred income tax expense trimmed income growth.\n\nBoosting its financial resources, in 2012 Devon Energy secured a commitment from Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration & Production for the Chinese company to invest $2.2 billion in exchange for one-third of Devon's interest in five new joint venture plays in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, Niobrara, Mississippian, Ohio Utica Shale, and the Michigan Basin.\n\nThat year it also closed a similar $1.4 billion joint venture deal with Sumitomo Corp. to develop 650,000 net acres in the Cline Shale and the Midland-Wolfcamp Shale in West Texas.\n\nStrategy\n\nIn 2010 it sold most of its remaining international assets to BP for $7 billion. As part of this deal BP sold undeveloped oil sand leases in Canada to Devon Energy for $500 million and formed a joint venture with the company to exploit them. The company also sold its Panyu field, offshore China, to China National Offshore Oil for $515 million.\n\nConsolidating its North American assets to just its onshore properties, In 2010 Devon Energy sold its stakes in the Cascade, Jack and St. Malo fields in the Gulf of Mexico (about 200 million barrels of estimated recoverable reserves) to AP Moller-Maersk's oil unit for $1.3 billion. It also sold its remaining Gulf of Mexico shelf assets to Apache for $1 billion. \u2013 less",

            "description": "It's no surprise that Ameriprise Financial is a leading provider of financial advice. The company offers financial planning, products, and services to individual and institutional investors. Through Ameriprise Financial, Columbia Management, RiverSource, and other affiliates and brands, the company provides access to insurance, mutual funds, savings plans, personal trust services, retail brokerage, and other financial products and services. Its Ameriprise Bank subsidiary offers deposits and loans. Ameriprise, which has about $630 billion of assets under management, distributes its products primarily through a network of more than 9,700 financial advisors.\n\nThe company has been sharpening its focus on its branded adviser network. It sold its Securities America independent broker-dealer subsidiary to Ladenburg Thalmann for some $150 million in 2011. Shortly before the sale of the troubled unit, Ameriprise agreed to pay $160 million to settle claims that Securities America brokers sold securities in fraudulent companies.\n\nAmeriprise has been steadily boosting its assets under management and growing its client base (focusing on the affluent and mass affluent with at least $100,000 in investable assets). The company also is focused on geographic areas where those clients are congregated and has closed or consolidated offices in areas with less potential. While Columbia Management covers Ameriprise's main asset management market in the US, the company is increasing its global presence through its Threadneedle brand overseas. Ameriprise plans to grow its asset management operations in Europe, as well as in Australia, the Middle East, and Asia.\n\nAmeriprise's strategies have paid off. Volatile financial market conditions, which negatively impacted all of the company's operations, led to a decline in revenue in 2008 and 2009. However, the company returned to success in 2010 and revenues grew by more than 20% that year. Poor economic conditions continued in 2011. However, Ameriprise's operating net revenues climbed that year by about 10%. The boost was due to strong growth in the company's fee-based advisory and asset management businesses.\n\nAmeriprise Financial, which was founded in 1894, was spun off from American Express in 2005. \u2013 less",

As the primary operating subsidiary of Pacific Mutual Holding Company, Pacific Life offers a wide range of life insurance, asset management, and financial services products, including individual annuities and mutual funds. It also offers a variety of investment products and services for individuals, businesses, and pension plans. Subsidiary Pacific Life & Annuity offers the same mix of life insurance and investment products and services for individuals and businesses in New York. Pacific Life was founded in 1868.\n\nOperations\n\nPacific Life policyholders are members of parent Pacific Mutual Holding Company, which was created in 1997 following a conversion to the mutual holding company structure. Pacific LifeCorp is the intermediate stock holding company.\n\nWhile life insurance is the company's bread and butter, it has brought in other operations for variety. Pacific Life's Aviation Capital Group subsidiary leases commercial jets to 90 airlines in more than 40 countries. It also manages aircraft assets for third parties such as commercial airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and financial institutions. Other subsidiaries include Pacific Asset Management, which provides third-party institutional asset management.\n\nSales & Marketing\n\nPacific Life's insurance policies are sold through independent distributors and through dealer/broker subsidiary Pacific Select Distributors.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nThe company's growth strategies helped Pacific Life achieve strong results in 2011, with revenues increasing 15% over 2010 to almost 6.7 billion, and net income increasing 29% to $679 million. Its operating income climbed a whopping 40% over 2010 to reach $823 million. The gains achieved were attributed to enhanced service offerings, expanded life insurance, annuity, and mutual fund product offerings, and the two acquisitions made that year.\n\nStrategy\n\nBeing a mutual company, Pacific Life operates with a long-term focus to serve in the best interests of its policyholders and clients. in doing so, the company navigated the chilly economic waters of the 2008-2009 recession by steadily introducing new products and building up its capital reserves. By 2010 its net income had grown as risk-weary customers squirreled more of their savings and retirement monies into life insurance and mutual funds.\n\nMergers, Acquisitions & Divestitures\n\nIn 2008 the company added international reinsurance to its portfolio when it acquired the former London-based specialty reinsurance operations of Scottish Re and renamed the business as Pacific Life Re. It then added life retrocession (reinsurance of a reinsurer) to its line-up in 2011 by acquiring that business from Manulife and expanded its business to include the Toronto, Boston, Barbados, and Cologne markets.\n\nAlso in 2011 Pacific life bought JPMorgan Chase's pension risk advisory business to form Pacific Global Advisors. The unit offers risk management solutions and advisory services to pension plan sponsors.\n\nThe firm divested a noncore business, College Savings Bank, in 2012 to a syndicate of investors for an undisclosed price. The banking unit managed two state-sponsored 529 college savings plans. \u2013 less",

CenterPoint Energy's regulated utilities distribute natural gas to 3.3 million customers in six US states and electricity to more than 2 million customers on the Texas Gulf Coast. The company's main stomping ground is Texas, where it has regulated power distribution operations through subsidiary CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric. CenterPoint Energy operates more than 48,230 miles of power distribution lines, 8,000 miles of interstate gas pipeline, and 3,800 miles of gas gathering pipeline. It also provides natural gas field services. \n\nOperations\n\nThe company's natural gas distribution subsidiaries serve customers in Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas. (Texas represented 47% of all natural gas distribution customers in 2010). CenterPoint Energy also markets natural gas and related services to 12,200 commercial, industrial, and wholesale customers located primarily in the eastern US. It also provides HVAC and other energy-related services through its gas division.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nCenterPoint Energy's sales dropped dramatically in 2009 as the global recession prompted a slump in commodity prices which hurt the performance of its different energy segments. A reviving economy in 2010 led to a stronger demand for power and gas (coupled with rate increases and weather-related spikes in consumption) resulting in a overall jump in revenues and net income that year.\n\nStrategy\n\nCenterPoint Energy's strategy is focused on enhancing and expanding existing core operations, while acquiring complementary and synergistic businesses. In 2011 the company acquired Denver-based natural gas marketing firm Asgard Energy, which supplies gas to agricultural, commercial, industrial, and residential customers in five states (Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, and West Virginia). The acquisition fit into CenterPoint's strategy to expand into the Rockies and diversify into residential choice markets.\n\nIn 2012, to add to its midstream assets, CenterPoint Energy Field Services (CEFS), an indirect subsidiary of the company, acquired gathering and processing assets from Prism Gas Systems, a subsidiary of Martin Midstream Partners for $275 million. The assets include Prism's 50% stake in Texas-based Waskom Gas Processing Co. A CEFS subsidiary owns the other 50% stake in Waskom.  \u2013 less",

CenterPoint Energy's regulated utilities distribute natural gas to 3.3 million customers in six US states and electricity to more than 2 million customers on the Texas Gulf Coast. The company's main stomping ground is Texas, where it has regulated power distribution operations through subsidiary CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric. CenterPoint Energy operates more than 48,230 miles of power distribution lines, 8,000 miles of interstate gas pipeline, and 3,800 miles of gas gathering pipeline. It also provides natural gas field services. \n\nOperations\n\nThe company's natural gas distribution subsidiaries serve customers in Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas. (Texas represented 47% of all natural gas distribution customers in 2010). CenterPoint Energy also markets natural gas and related services to 12,200 commercial, industrial, and wholesale customers located primarily in the eastern US. It also provides HVAC and other energy-related services through its gas division.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nCenterPoint Energy's sales dropped dramatically in 2009 as the global recession prompted a slump in commodity prices which hurt the performance of its different energy segments. A reviving economy in 2010 led to a stronger demand for power and gas (coupled with rate increases and weather-related spikes in consumption) resulting in a overall jump in revenues and net income that year.\n\nStrategy\n\nCenterPoint Energy's strategy is focused on enhancing and expanding existing core operations, while acquiring complementary and synergistic businesses. In 2011 the company acquired Denver-based natural gas marketing firm Asgard Energy, which supplies gas to agricultural, commercial, industrial, and residential customers in five states (Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, and West Virginia). The acquisition fit into CenterPoint's strategy to expand into the Rockies and diversify into residential choice markets.\n\nIn 2012, to add to its midstream assets, CenterPoint Energy Field Services (CEFS), an indirect subsidiary of the company, acquired gathering and processing assets from Prism Gas Systems, a subsidiary of Martin Midstream Partners for $275 million. The assets include Prism's 50% stake in Texas-based Waskom Gas Processing Co. A CEFS subsidiary owns the other 50% stake in Waskom.  \u2013 less",

The company offers financial planning, products, and services to individual and institutional investors. Through Ameriprise Financial, Columbia Management, RiverSource, and other affiliates and brands, the company provides access to insurance, mutual funds, savings plans, personal trust services, retail brokerage, and other financial products and services. Its Ameriprise Bank subsidiary offers deposits and loans. Ameriprise, which has about $630 billion of assets under management, distributes its products primarily through a network of more than 9,700 financial advisors.\n\nThe company has been sharpening its focus on its branded adviser network. It sold its Securities America independent broker-dealer subsidiary to Ladenburg Thalmann for some $150 million in 2011. Shortly before the sale of the troubled unit, Ameriprise agreed to pay $160 million to settle claims that Securities America brokers sold securities in fraudulent companies.\n\nAmeriprise has been steadily boosting its assets under management and growing its client base (focusing on the affluent and mass affluent with at least $100,000 in investable assets). The company also is focused on geographic areas where those clients are congregated and has closed or consolidated offices in areas with less potential. While Columbia Management covers Ameriprise's main asset management market in the US, the company is increasing its global presence through its Threadneedle brand overseas. Ameriprise plans to grow its asset management operations in Europe, as well as in Australia, the Middle East, and Asia.\n\nAmeriprise's strategies have paid off. Volatile financial market conditions, which negatively impacted all of the company's operations, led to a decline in revenue in 2008 and 2009. However, the company returned to success in 2010 and revenues grew by more than 20% that year. Poor economic conditions continued in 2011. However, Ameriprise's operating net revenues climbed that year by about 10%. The boost was due to strong growth in the company's fee-based advisory and asset management businesses.\n\nAmeriprise Financial, which was founded in 1894, was spun off from American Express in 2005. \u2013 less",

            "description": "Celanese Corporation gets a lot of good ink about its acetates. The company's primary operations include the manufacture of building block chemicals like acetic acid and vinyl acetate monomers. Those chemicals are used in everything from inks and paints to agricultural products and chewing gum. Canadian subsidiary Acetex, the majority of whose sales come from Europe, is the world's largest acetyls manufacturer. Other products include acetate tow (in cigarette filters); industrial specialties like ethylene vinyl aceta; and engineered plastics. The bulk of sales come from the US and Germany. \n\nOperations\n\nCelanese operates through four business segments: Advanced Engineered Materials, Consumer Specialties, Industrial Specialties, and Acetyl Intermediates. The company is one of the world's largest producers of acetyl products, as well as a top global producer of engineered polymers.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nIn addition to manufacturing sites in the US, it also has properties, plants, and equipment in Belgium, China, Canada, Germany, Mexico, and Singapore.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nCelanese continued its recovery from the recession of 2008-09 with a 14% increase in revenues in 2011, due primarily to higher volumes and increased sales prices across most of its business segments. The largest gains were in its Industrial Specialties unit (up 18%), Advanced Engineered Materials unit (up 17%), and its Acetyl Intermediates segment (up 15%). Net income grew by 61% in 2011, as increased revenues outpaced a more modest growth in operating expenses.\n\nStrategy\n\nCelanese's strategy is to grow the company through expansion into emerging regions, particularly China; to offer innovation through developing new products and applications; increase its productivity through energy reduction, business process improvements, and manufacturing optimization; and boost its portfolio by growing its business through both acquisitions or internal growth.\n\nIn 2012 the company teamed up with Indonesia's Pertamina, forming a joint venture to develop fuel ethanol projects in that country.\n\nTo grow its emulsion polymers business, in 2011 the company acquired two product lines, Vinac and Flexbond, from Ashland. The acquisition is expected to speed up growth of the company's emulsion polymers operations throughout the Americas -- especially in the adhesives, textiles, coatings, and paper segments.\n\nCelanese subsidiary Ticona Engineering Polymers acquired two product lines, Zenite liquid crystal polymer and Thermx polycyclohexylene-dimethylene terephthalate, from DuPont Performance Polymers division in 2010. The units expanded Celanese's offerings in the electrical and electronics application segments of the global polymers market. \n\nOwnership\n\nIn 2012 Capital Research Global Investors owned about 11% of Celanese, with several other investment firms owning a smaller stakes.\n\nCompany Background\n\nCelanese Corporation was created in 2004 by the Blackstone Group, which had acquired a majority share in Celanese AG, turned it private, and then flipped it in a 2005 public offering. Blackstone finally divested its remaining holdings in Celanese in 2007. \u2013 less",

Through its Foodservice division, PFG supplies more than 68,000 products to independent restaurants, hotels, other hospitality operators, and healthcare facilities through some 20 distribution facilities. The PFG Customized distribution unit serves chain restaurants such as Cracker Barrel and Ruby Tuesday. PFG subsidiary Vistar is a distributor of candy, snacks, and convenience foods for vending operators, retailers, and concessions. The company is owned by The Blackstone Group and Wellspring Capital Management, which took the business private in 2008.\n\nOperations\n\nWith the $1.3 billion buyout in 2008 PFG was merged with Colorado-based Vistar (which was already controlled by Blackstone) to create a giant in the foodservice distribution industry with tentacles reaching into several markets. The combined business continues to operate under the PFG name, although each unit maintains its own headquarters. Across the company's foodservice, Vistar, and customized distribution businesses PFG collectively delivers more than 98,000 national- and proprietary-branded food and food-related products to more than 128,000 customers. As part of its operations, PFG maintains about 70 distribution centers and more than a dozen Merchant's Mart locations in the US.\n\nStrategy\n\nFor PFG's broadline Performance Foodservice division, the focus has been on building the range of products it distributes to existing customers while improving margins. The division's more than 41,000 customers, located in about 40 countries, include franchisees of such chains as Burger King, Popeyes (owned by AFC Enterprises), and Subway. It also serves contract foodservice operators, such as Compass Group North America.\n\nMergers and Acquisitions\n\nThe company moved to expand its broadline division in mid-2012 by acquiring Carolina-based rival Institution Food House from Alex Lee. It also entered into an agreement in late 2012 to buy independent broadline foodservice distributor Fox River Foods, which serves seven states primarily in the Upper Midwestern region. The deals followed PFG's purchase in 2010 of Ledyard Company, which serves central and northern California. To add breadth to its product offering at its New England and Ohio offices, PFG in 2010 bought out the assets of VME Distributors. The wholesale supplier catered to mobile caterers, office coffee services, schools, prisons, and vending operators that do business in New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. \u2013 less",

            "description": "DCP Midstream Partners is the publicly traded entity of DCP Midstream LLC, one of the largest natural gas gatherers in North America and also the top producer and one of the primary marketers of natural gas liquids (NGLs). It also engages in natural gas compressing, treating, processing, transporting, and selling. DCP Midstream LLC also transports and sells NGLs and distributes propane wholesale. The company operates natural gas gathering systems (5,300 miles of pipe) in eight states (including Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas), seven processing plants, four NGL pipelines, and nine propane storage terminals. Spectra Energy holds a 50% holding in DCP (ConocoPhillips holds the other 50%).\n\nA consolidator in the fragmented natural gas gathering, NGLs, and wholesale propane industry segments, the company has been expanding its gas supply base and its propane wholesale network in recent years through strategic complementary acquisitions and joint ventures.\n\nIn 2012 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Texas-based Crossroads processing plant and gathering system from Penn Virginia Resource Partners for $63 million. The bolt-on acquisition allows the company to expand its market position in East Texas and provide services to drillers in the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley regions.\n\nIn 2011 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Seaway Products Pipeline Co. from ConocoPhillips. The pipeline, now called Southern Hills Pipeline and being converted to NGL service, is expected to be operational by mid-2013. It will provide NGL access from the Midcontinent to the Texas Gulf Coast.\n\nThe company agreed to form a joint venture with EQT Corporation to develop natural gas processing and related natural gas liquid (NGL) infrastructure in the Marcellus and Huron shale plays in the Appalachian basin. (However, the parties could not come to agreement and dropped the plan in early 2011). In 2010, the company acquired the Liberty gathering system and south Raywood processing plant from Ceritas Energy in southeast Texas. The pipeline system interconnects with DCP Midstream's Centana Intrastate Pipeline system.\n\nExpanding in Michigan, in 2009 the company acquired gas gathering and treating assets for $45.1 million. In 2010 it acquired a 350-mile interstate natural gas liquids pipeline system in Colorado's Denver-Julesburg Basin from Buckeye Partners for $22 million.\n\nIn 2010 DCP Midstream Partners moved to extend its Northeast wholesale propane business into the MidAtlantic region, acquiring UGI's Atlantic Energy for $49 million. That year it also purchased of NGL storage company Marysville Hydrocarbon Holdings (in Michigan) for about $95 million.\n\nAlthough DCP Midstream Partners' revenues suffered in 2009 as a result of the global recession and lower commodity prices, acquisitions and organic growth managed to offset lower natural gas volumes.  Acquisitions, increased demand, higher commodity and propane prices, and gains on derivatives help to lift the company's revenues and net income in 2010.\n\nIn terms of the company's origins, the D in DCP Midstream Partners (formerly Duke Energy Field Services) is for Duke Energy; the CP, ConocoPhillips. These two energy majors formed DCP Midstream Partners in 2005. Following the spinoff of Spectra Energy from Duke Energy in 2007, Spectra Energy assumed Duke Energy's 50% holding in DCP. \u2013 less",

Its Ameriprise Bank subsidiary offers deposits and loans. Ameriprise, which has about $630 billion of assets under management, distributes its products primarily through a network of more than 9,700 financial advisors.\n\nThe company has been sharpening its focus on its branded adviser network. It sold its Securities America independent broker-dealer subsidiary to Ladenburg Thalmann for some $150 million in 2011. Shortly before the sale of the troubled unit, Ameriprise agreed to pay $160 million to settle claims that Securities America brokers sold securities in fraudulent companies.\n\nAmeriprise has been steadily boosting its assets under management and growing its client base (focusing on the affluent and mass affluent with at least $100,000 in investable assets). The company also is focused on geographic areas where those clients are congregated and has closed or consolidated offices in areas with less potential. While Columbia Management covers Ameriprise's main asset management market in the US, the company is increasing its global presence through its Threadneedle brand overseas. Ameriprise plans to grow its asset management operations in Europe, as well as in Australia, the Middle East, and Asia.\n\nAmeriprise's strategies have paid off. Volatile financial market conditions, which negatively impacted all of the company's operations, led to a decline in revenue in 2008 and 2009. However, the company returned to success in 2010 and revenues grew by more than 20% that year. Poor economic conditions continued in 2011. However, Ameriprise's operating net revenues climbed that year by about 10%. The boost was due to strong growth in the company's fee-based advisory and asset management businesses.\n\nAmeriprise Financial, which was founded in 1894, was spun off from American Express in 2005. \u2013 less",

The bank is primarily active in the UK, where it has some 1,700 branches, but also has significant retail and commercial operations in Europe, Africa (it owns more than half of South African bank Absa Group), the Middle East, and the US. Barclays Bank offers standard retail services such as deposit accounts and lending, including Woolwich-brand mortgages. The bank also provides commercial money transfer services, insurance products, the Barclaycard line of credit cards, and financial advisory services. Barclays Bank traces its roots to the late 17th century.\n\nBarclays Bank has been building up its portfolio of global credit card accounts, especially as other financial groups sell off noncore units during the economic recovery. In 2010 the company acquired the Italian credit card accounts of Citigroup in a deal that included some 197,000 card accounts and approximately \u20ac234 million ($320 million) worth of assets. It previously bought Goldfish, the struggling UK credit card unit of Discover Financial Services, for some \u00a346 million ($70 million). In 2011 Barclays acquired Egg UK's credit card portfolio, which added more than 1 million accounts; it has agreed to buy more Citibank card accounts.\n\nThe bank has also been offloading some of its own holdings as part of an overall corporate restructuring. In 2010 Barclays sold its US subprime loan servicing business, HomEq Servicing, to Ocwen Financial. It also announced plans to abandon retail banking in certain international markets and instead focus on wholesale and commercial banking. In 2011 it shuttered its Indonesian retail unit Bank Akita, which it had acquired only two years before. The company also sold its Russian retail and commercial operations to a group of investors, citing difficulties competing in the market. Barclays will instead focus on its investment banking activities in the region.\n\nIn 2010 Barclays acquired Standard Life Bank from Standard Life for \u00a3226 million ($369 million). The deal added Standard Life's savings and mortgage books to the Barclays fold. Also as part of the deal, Barclays and Standard Life entered into a partnership whereby Barclays markets pension products to its clients.\n\nDespite challenges in the economy, especially in regards to Europe's debt problems, Barclays Bank's revenues grew 8% in 2011. Its Africa business performed relatively strongly, with credit impairments improving, as did Barclaycard, thanks to the portfolio acquisitions which delivered profits. That year the bank closed nearly 150 European branches (largely located in Spain), the costs of which contributed to a 5% decline in net income. \u2013 less",

Through Ameriprise Financial, Columbia Management, RiverSource, and other affiliates and brands, the company provides access to insurance, mutual funds, savings plans, personal trust services, retail brokerage, and other financial products and services. Its Ameriprise Bank subsidiary offers deposits and loans. Ameriprise, which has about $630 billion of assets under management, distributes its products primarily through a network of more than 9,700 financial advisors.\n\nThe company has been sharpening its focus on its branded adviser network. It sold its Securities America independent broker-dealer subsidiary to Ladenburg Thalmann for some $150 million in 2011. Shortly before the sale of the troubled unit, Ameriprise agreed to pay $160 million to settle claims that Securities America brokers sold securities in fraudulent companies.\n\nAmeriprise has been steadily boosting its assets under management and growing its client base (focusing on the affluent and mass affluent with at least $100,000 in investable assets). The company also is focused on geographic areas where those clients are congregated and has closed or consolidated offices in areas with less potential. While Columbia Management covers Ameriprise's main asset management market in the US, the company is increasing its global presence through its Threadneedle brand overseas. Ameriprise plans to grow its asset management operations in Europe, as well as in Australia, the Middle East, and Asia.\n\nAmeriprise's strategies have paid off. Volatile financial market conditions, which negatively impacted all of the company's operations, led to a decline in revenue in 2008 and 2009. However, the company returned to success in 2010 and revenues grew by more than 20% that year. Poor economic conditions continued in 2011. However, Ameriprise's operating net revenues climbed that year by about 10%. The boost was due to strong growth in the company's fee-based advisory and asset management businesses.\n\nAmeriprise Financial, which was founded in 1894, was spun off from American Express in 2005. \u2013 less",

Auto-Owners Insurance Group operates through subsidiaries including Auto-Owners Life Insurance, Home-Owners Insurance, and Property-Owners Insurance Company. Its Southern-Owners Insurance subsidiary offers property/casualty insurance in Florida. Auto-Owners Insurance also sells commercial auto, liability, and workers' compensation policies.

The company's largest markets are Florida and Michigan.\n\nOperations\n\nAuto-Owners' revenues come from insurance premiums, as well as investment income. The company's property/casualty business accounts for about 90% of revenues and 80% of profits, with the remainder coming from premiums and income from the life insurance segment.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nAuto-Owners reported a 5% increase in net written premiums in 2011 to nearly $5.2 billion, primarily due to growth within the Auto-Owners Insurance, Auto-Owners Life, and Home-Owners Insurance divisions. Total revenues were some $5.7 billion, while net income was reported at $69 million.\n\nStrategy\n\nAuto-Owners is focused on growing its business by establishing strong relationships with independent agents and by diversifying its product offerings. The company has also expanded by adding sales and service facilities in new and existing markets. In 2011 Auto-Owners opened five new branch locations to handle claims in Ashville, North Carolina; Kennesaw, Georgia; Little Rock, Arkansas; Madison, Wisconsin; and Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

            "description": "Celanese Corporation gets a lot of good ink about its acetates. The company's primary operations include the manufacture of building block chemicals like acetic acid and vinyl acetate monomers. Those chemicals are used in everything from inks and paints to agricultural products and chewing gum. Canadian subsidiary Acetex, the majority of whose sales come from Europe, is the world's largest acetyls manufacturer. Other products include acetate tow (in cigarette filters); industrial specialties like ethylene vinyl aceta; and engineered plastics. The bulk of sales come from the US and Germany. \n\nOperations\n\nCelanese operates through four business segments: Advanced Engineered Materials, Consumer Specialties, Industrial Specialties, and Acetyl Intermediates. The company is one of the world's largest producers of acetyl products, as well as a top global producer of engineered polymers.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nIn addition to manufacturing sites in the US, it also has properties, plants, and equipment in Belgium, China, Canada, Germany, Mexico, and Singapore.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nCelanese continued its recovery from the recession of 2008-09 with a 14% increase in revenues in 2011, due primarily to higher volumes and increased sales prices across most of its business segments. The largest gains were in its Industrial Specialties unit (up 18%), Advanced Engineered Materials unit (up 17%), and its Acetyl Intermediates segment (up 15%). Net income grew by 61% in 2011, as increased revenues outpaced a more modest growth in operating expenses.\n\nStrategy\n\nCelanese's strategy is to grow the company through expansion into emerging regions, particularly China; to offer innovation through developing new products and applications; increase its productivity through energy reduction, business process improvements, and manufacturing optimization; and boost its portfolio by growing its business through both acquisitions or internal growth.\n\nIn 2012 the company teamed up with Indonesia's Pertamina, forming a joint venture to develop fuel ethanol projects in that country.\n\nTo grow its emulsion polymers business, in 2011 the company acquired two product lines, Vinac and Flexbond, from Ashland. The acquisition is expected to speed up growth of the company's emulsion polymers operations throughout the Americas -- especially in the adhesives, textiles, coatings, and paper segments.\n\nCelanese subsidiary Ticona Engineering Polymers acquired two product lines, Zenite liquid crystal polymer and Thermx polycyclohexylene-dimethylene terephthalate, from DuPont Performance Polymers division in 2010. The units expanded Celanese's offerings in the electrical and electronics application segments of the global polymers market. \n\nOwnership\n\nIn 2012 Capital Research Global Investors owned about 11% of Celanese, with several other investment firms owning a smaller stakes.\n\nCompany Background\n\nCelanese Corporation was created in 2004 by the Blackstone Group, which had acquired a majority share in Celanese AG, turned it private, and then flipped it in a 2005 public offering. Blackstone finally divested its remaining holdings in Celanese in 2007. \u2013 less",

The bank is primarily active in the UK, where it has some 1,700 branches, but also has significant retail and commercial operations in Europe, Africa (it owns more than half of South African bank Absa Group), the Middle East, and the US. Barclays Bank offers standard retail services such as deposit accounts and lending, including Woolwich-brand mortgages. The bank also provides commercial money transfer services, insurance products, the Barclaycard line of credit cards, and financial advisory services. Barclays Bank traces its roots to the late 17th century.\n\nBarclays Bank has been building up its portfolio of global credit card accounts, especially as other financial groups sell off noncore units during the economic recovery. In 2010 the company acquired the Italian credit card accounts of Citigroup in a deal that included some 197,000 card accounts and approximately \u20ac234 million ($320 million) worth of assets. It previously bought Goldfish, the struggling UK credit card unit of Discover Financial Services, for some \u00a346 million ($70 million). In 2011 Barclays acquired Egg UK's credit card portfolio, which added more than 1 million accounts; it has agreed to buy more Citibank card accounts.\n\nThe bank has also been offloading some of its own holdings as part of an overall corporate restructuring. In 2010 Barclays sold its US subprime loan servicing business, HomEq Servicing, to Ocwen Financial. It also announced plans to abandon retail banking in certain international markets and instead focus on wholesale and commercial banking. In 2011 it shuttered its Indonesian retail unit Bank Akita, which it had acquired only two years before. The company also sold its Russian retail and commercial operations to a group of investors, citing difficulties competing in the market. Barclays will instead focus on its investment banking activities in the region.\n\nIn 2010 Barclays acquired Standard Life Bank from Standard Life for \u00a3226 million ($369 million). The deal added Standard Life's savings and mortgage books to the Barclays fold. Also as part of the deal, Barclays and Standard Life entered into a partnership whereby Barclays markets pension products to its clients.\n\nDespite challenges in the economy, especially in regards to Europe's debt problems, Barclays Bank's revenues grew 8% in 2011. Its Africa business performed relatively strongly, with credit impairments improving, as did Barclaycard, thanks to the portfolio acquisitions which delivered profits. That year the bank closed nearly 150 European branches (largely located in Spain), the costs of which contributed to a 5% decline in net income. \u2013 less",

The company sells some 30 brands of cars and light trucks and offers vehicle financing. Chairman Smith, who runs Sonic Automotive with his son Scott, is also the majority owner of Speedway Motorsports, which operates more than half a dozen NASCAR auto racetracks.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nOverall, the company's revenues in 2011 accounted for some $7.8 billion versus around $3.6 billion in 2010. Net income came in at $77.6 million in 2011 compared to $95.9 million in 2010, a 15% decrease. In 2011 the impact of earthquakes and the tsunami that struck Japan disrupted the company's Japanese supply chain and vehicle production. Sonic's new vehicle revenues and gross margins were impacted, thus affecting net income. Sonics' new vehicle sales generated around $4.3 million (about 55% of revenues) in revenues in 2011; used vehicle sales accounted for some $2 million (around 25% of revenues), and the company's parts, service and collision segment accounted for around $1.2 million (some 15% of revenues) in revenues.\n\nOperations\n\nIn 2011 the company sold approximately 12.7 million new vehicles compared to 11.6 million vehicles sold in 2010, a year-over-year increase of some 10%. The company sells new vehicles, including luxury (BMW, Lexus, Land Rover, and Volvo), mid-line import (Honda, Nissan, and Toyota), and domestic brands (Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors). Its luxury brands generated some 50% of revenues in 2011; while the company's mid-line and domestic brands accounted for about 35% and 15%, respectively.\n\nStrategy\n\nAs part of the company's strategic plans, Sonic is primarily focused in growing its operations in metropolitan markets in the Southeast, Southwest, Midwest, and the West (California).

Its Ameriprise Bank subsidiary offers deposits and loans. Ameriprise, which has about $630 billion of assets under management, distributes its products primarily through a network of more than 9,700 financial advisors.\n\nThe company has been sharpening its focus on its branded adviser network. It sold its Securities America independent broker-dealer subsidiary to Ladenburg Thalmann for some $150 million in 2011. Shortly before the sale of the troubled unit, Ameriprise agreed to pay $160 million to settle claims that Securities America brokers sold securities in fraudulent companies.\n\nAmeriprise has been steadily boosting its assets under management and growing its client base (focusing on the affluent and mass affluent with at least $100,000 in investable assets). The company also is focused on geographic areas where those clients are congregated and has closed or consolidated offices in areas with less potential. While Columbia Management covers Ameriprise's main asset management market in the US, the company is increasing its global presence through its Threadneedle brand overseas. Ameriprise plans to grow its asset management operations in Europe, as well as in Australia, the Middle East, and Asia.\n\nAmeriprise's strategies have paid off. Volatile financial market conditions, which negatively impacted all of the company's operations, led to a decline in revenue in 2008 and 2009. However, the company returned to success in 2010 and revenues grew by more than 20% that year. Poor economic conditions continued in 2011. However, Ameriprise's operating net revenues climbed that year by about 10%. The boost was due to strong growth in the company's fee-based advisory and asset management businesses.\n\nAmeriprise Financial, which was founded in 1894, was spun off from American Express in 2005. \u2013 less",

It also markets and trades electricity to wholesale and retail customers and provides risk management and other energy-related services.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nAmeren's overall revenues dipped in 2011. While increased rates helped to lift Ameren Missouri's revenues in 2011, Ameren Illinois' regulated segment and the merchant generation segment both reported a drop in revenues. In particular, low gas prices and a warm winter hurt gas revenues. However, lower purchased power and resale gas, coupled with a drop in goodwill, impairment, and other charges, helped to lift Ameren's net income for the year.\n\nFavorable weather conditions (which increased energy demand) and rate increases help to lift the company's revenues in 2010. However, impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets in the merchant generation segment (due to the sustained decline in market prices for electricity) dragged down Ameren's operating income.\n\nStrategy\n\nIn 2010 the company combined AmerenIP, AmerenCIPS, and AmerenCILCO into one entity, Ameren Illinois, in order to streamline operations and reduce confusion among customers. The three Illinois utilities have operated as a single business since 2004 and deliver energy to more than 1,100 communities. Ameren Illinois also operates some 21,400 miles of natural gas distribution and transmission lines.\n\nTo comply with federal requirements to separate ownership of power generation and transmission businesses, the operations of Ameren subsidiaries' transmission assets are under the control ofMidwest Independent Transmission System Operator, a regional transmission organization that coordinates power across 15 Midwestern states and one Canadian Province.  \u2013 less",

The holding company distributes electricity to 2.4 million customers and natural gas to 900,000 customers in Missouri and Illinois through utility subsidiaries. Ameren has a generating capacity of 16,000 MW (primarily coal-fired), most of which is controlled by utility Union Electric (which does business as Ameren Missouri) and nonregulated subsidiary AmerenEnergy Resources Generating Company. Ameren, which also supplies merchant generation power to third parties, operates a nuclear power facility, three hydroelectric plants, and several coal-fired plants and turbine combustion facilities. It also purchases power, including windpower.\n\nOperations\n\nIn addition to operating power plants, Ameren procures natural gas for its affiliated companies, builds new power plants, and provides long-term energy supply contracts. It also markets and trades electricity to wholesale and retail customers and provides risk management and other energy-related services.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nAmeren's overall revenues dipped in 2011. While increased rates helped to lift Ameren Missouri's revenues in 2011, Ameren Illinois' regulated segment and the merchant generation segment both reported a drop in revenues. In particular, low gas prices and a warm winter hurt gas revenues. However, lower purchased power and resale gas, coupled with a drop in goodwill, impairment, and other charges, helped to lift Ameren's net income for the year.\n\nFavorable weather conditions (which increased energy demand) and rate increases help to lift the company's revenues in 2010. However, impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets in the merchant generation segment (due to the sustained decline in market prices for electricity) dragged down Ameren's operating income.\n\nStrategy\n\nIn 2010 the company combined AmerenIP, AmerenCIPS, and AmerenCILCO into one entity, Ameren Illinois, in order to streamline operations and reduce confusion among customers. The three Illinois utilities have operated as a single business since 2004 and deliver energy to more than 1,100 communities. Ameren Illinois also operates some 21,400 miles of natural gas distribution and transmission lines.\n\nTo comply with federal requirements to separate ownership of power generation and transmission businesses, the operations of Ameren subsidiaries' transmission assets are under the control ofMidwest Independent Transmission System Operator, a regional transmission organization that coordinates power across 15 Midwestern states and one Canadian Province.  \u2013 less",

It also engages in natural gas compressing, treating, processing, transporting, and selling. DCP Midstream LLC also transports and sells NGLs and distributes propane wholesale. The company operates natural gas gathering systems (5,300 miles of pipe) in eight states (including Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas), seven processing plants, four NGL pipelines, and nine propane storage terminals. Spectra Energy holds a 50% holding in DCP (ConocoPhillips holds the other 50%).\n\nA consolidator in the fragmented natural gas gathering, NGLs, and wholesale propane industry segments, the company has been expanding its gas supply base and its propane wholesale network in recent years through strategic complementary acquisitions and joint ventures.\n\nIn 2012 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Texas-based Crossroads processing plant and gathering system from Penn Virginia Resource Partners for $63 million. The bolt-on acquisition allows the company to expand its market position in East Texas and provide services to drillers in the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley regions.\n\nIn 2011 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Seaway Products Pipeline Co. from ConocoPhillips. The pipeline, now called Southern Hills Pipeline and being converted to NGL service, is expected to be operational by mid-2013. It will provide NGL access from the Midcontinent to the Texas Gulf Coast.\n\nThe company agreed to form a joint venture with EQT Corporation to develop natural gas processing and related natural gas liquid (NGL) infrastructure in the Marcellus and Huron shale plays in the Appalachian basin. (However, the parties could not come to agreement and dropped the plan in early 2011). In 2010, the company acquired the Liberty gathering system and south Raywood processing plant from Ceritas Energy in southeast Texas. The pipeline system interconnects with DCP Midstream's Centana Intrastate Pipeline system.\n\nExpanding in Michigan, in 2009 the company acquired gas gathering and treating assets for $45.1 million. In 2010 it acquired a 350-mile interstate natural gas liquids pipeline system in Colorado's Denver-Julesburg Basin from Buckeye Partners for $22 million.\n\nIn 2010 DCP Midstream Partners moved to extend its Northeast wholesale propane business into the MidAtlantic region, acquiring UGI's Atlantic Energy for $49 million. That year it also purchased of NGL storage company Marysville Hydrocarbon Holdings (in Michigan) for about $95 million.\n\nAlthough DCP Midstream Partners' revenues suffered in 2009 as a result of the global recession and lower commodity prices, acquisitions and organic growth managed to offset lower natural gas volumes.  Acquisitions, increased demand, higher commodity and propane prices, and gains on derivatives help to lift the company's revenues and net income in 2010.\n\nIn terms of the company's origins, the D in DCP Midstream Partners (formerly Duke Energy Field Services) is for Duke Energy; the CP, ConocoPhillips. These two energy majors formed DCP Midstream Partners in 2005. Following the spinoff of Spectra Energy from Duke Energy in 2007, Spectra Energy assumed Duke Energy's 50% holding in DCP. \u2013 less",

Bruton Smith has raced Sonic Automotive to the front of the pack of US auto dealers behind larger rivals, such as AutoNation and Penske Automotive. Founded with five dealerships in 1997, Sonic today owns about 120 new- and used-vehicle dealerships and about 25 collision repair centers in major markets in 15 states, including Texas, the Carolinas, Tennessee and Georgia. The company sells some 30 brands of cars and light trucks and offers vehicle financing. Chairman Smith, who runs Sonic Automotive with his son Scott, is also the majority owner of Speedway Motorsports, which operates more than half a dozen NASCAR auto racetracks.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nOverall, the company's revenues in 2011 accounted for some $7.8 billion versus around $3.6 billion in 2010. Net income came in at $77.6 million in 2011 compared to $95.9 million in 2010, a 15% decrease. In 2011 the impact of earthquakes and the tsunami that struck Japan disrupted the company's Japanese supply chain and vehicle production. Sonic's new vehicle revenues and gross margins were impacted, thus affecting net income. Sonics' new vehicle sales generated around $4.3 million (about 55% of revenues) in revenues in 2011; used vehicle sales accounted for some $2 million (around 25% of revenues), and the company's parts, service and collision segment accounted for around $1.2 million (some 15% of revenues) in revenues.\n\nOperations\n\nIn 2011 the company sold approximately 12.7 million new vehicles compared to 11.6 million vehicles sold in 2010, a year-over-year increase of some 10%. The company sells new vehicles, including luxury (BMW, Lexus, Land Rover, and Volvo), mid-line import (Honda, Nissan, and Toyota), and domestic brands (Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors). Its luxury brands generated some 50% of revenues in 2011; while the company's mid-line and domestic brands accounted for about 35% and 15%, respectively.\n\nStrategy\n\nAs part of the company's strategic plans, Sonic is primarily focused in growing its operations in metropolitan markets in the Southeast, Southwest, Midwest, and the West (California). The company's long-term growth strategy is to target luxury or mid-line import brands.\n\nOwnership\n\nThe Smiths control the company through their ownership of about 75% of Sonic Automotive's voting stock. \u2013 less",

The company offers financial planning, products, and services to individual and institutional investors. Through Ameriprise Financial, Columbia Management, RiverSource, and other affiliates and brands, the company provides access to insurance, mutual funds, savings plans, personal trust services, retail brokerage, and other financial products and services. Its Ameriprise Bank subsidiary offers deposits and loans. Ameriprise, which has about $630 billion of assets under management, distributes its products primarily through a network of more than 9,700 financial advisors.\n\nThe company has been sharpening its focus on its branded adviser network. It sold its Securities America independent broker-dealer subsidiary to Ladenburg Thalmann for some $150 million in 2011. Shortly before the sale of the troubled unit, Ameriprise agreed to pay $160 million to settle claims that Securities America brokers sold securities in fraudulent companies.\n\nAmeriprise has been steadily boosting its assets under management and growing its client base (focusing on the affluent and mass affluent with at least $100,000 in investable assets). The company also is focused on geographic areas where those clients are congregated and has closed or consolidated offices in areas with less potential. While Columbia Management covers Ameriprise's main asset management market in the US, the company is increasing its global presence through its Threadneedle brand overseas. Ameriprise plans to grow its asset management operations in Europe, as well as in Australia, the Middle East, and Asia.\n\nAmeriprise's strategies have paid off. Volatile financial market conditions, which negatively impacted all of the company's operations, led to a decline in revenue in 2008 and 2009. However, the company returned to success in 2010 and revenues grew by more than 20% that year. Poor economic conditions continued in 2011. However, Ameriprise's operating net revenues climbed that year by about 10%. The boost was due to strong growth in the company's fee-based advisory and asset management businesses.\n\nAmeriprise Financial, which was founded in 1894, was spun off from American Express in 2005. \u2013 less",

            "description": "No stranger to speed, O. Bruton Smith has raced Sonic Automotive to the front of the pack of US auto dealers behind larger rivals, such as AutoNation and Penske Automotive. Founded with five dealerships in 1997, Sonic today owns about 120 new- and used-vehicle dealerships and about 25 collision repair centers in major markets in 15 states, including Texas, the Carolinas, Tennessee and Georgia. The company sells some 30 brands of cars and light trucks and offers vehicle financing. Chairman Smith, who runs Sonic Automotive with his son Scott, is also the majority owner of Speedway Motorsports, which operates more than half a dozen NASCAR auto racetracks.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nOverall, the company's revenues in 2011 accounted for some $7.8 billion versus around $3.6 billion in 2010. Net income came in at $77.6 million in 2011 compared to $95.9 million in 2010, a 15% decrease. In 2011 the impact of earthquakes and the tsunami that struck Japan disrupted the company's Japanese supply chain and vehicle production. Sonic's new vehicle revenues and gross margins were impacted, thus affecting net income. Sonics' new vehicle sales generated around $4.3 million (about 55% of revenues) in revenues in 2011; used vehicle sales accounted for some $2 million (around 25% of revenues), and the company's parts, service and collision segment accounted for around $1.2 million (some 15% of revenues) in revenues.\n\nOperations\n\nIn 2011 the company sold approximately 12.7 million new vehicles compared to 11.6 million vehicles sold in 2010, a year-over-year increase of some 10%. The company sells new vehicles, including luxury (BMW, Lexus, Land Rover, and Volvo), mid-line import (Honda, Nissan, and Toyota), and domestic brands (Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors). Its luxury brands generated some 50% of revenues in 2011; while the company's mid-line and domestic brands accounted for about 35% and 15%, respectively.\n\nStrategy\n\nAs part of the company's strategic plans, Sonic is primarily focused in growing its operations in metropolitan markets in the Southeast, Southwest, Midwest, and the West (California). The company's long-term growth strategy is to target luxury or mid-line import brands.\n\nOwnership\n\nThe Smiths control the company through their ownership of about 75% of Sonic Automotive's voting stock. \u2013 less",

CenterPoint Energy's regulated utilities distribute natural gas to 3.3 million customers in six US states and electricity to more than 2 million customers on the Texas Gulf Coast. The company's main stomping ground is Texas, where it has regulated power distribution operations through subsidiary CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric. CenterPoint Energy operates more than 48,230 miles of power distribution lines, 8,000 miles of interstate gas pipeline, and 3,800 miles of gas gathering pipeline. It also provides natural gas field services. \n\nOperations\n\nThe company's natural gas distribution subsidiaries serve customers in Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas. (Texas represented 47% of all natural gas distribution customers in 2010). CenterPoint Energy also markets natural gas and related services to 12,200 commercial, industrial, and wholesale customers located primarily in the eastern US. It also provides HVAC and other energy-related services through its gas division.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nCenterPoint Energy's sales dropped dramatically in 2009 as the global recession prompted a slump in commodity prices which hurt the performance of its different energy segments. A reviving economy in 2010 led to a stronger demand for power and gas (coupled with rate increases and weather-related spikes in consumption) resulting in a overall jump in revenues and net income that year.\n\nStrategy\n\nCenterPoint Energy's strategy is focused on enhancing and expanding existing core operations, while acquiring complementary and synergistic businesses. In 2011 the company acquired Denver-based natural gas marketing firm Asgard Energy, which supplies gas to agricultural, commercial, industrial, and residential customers in five states (Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, and West Virginia). The acquisition fit into CenterPoint's strategy to expand into the Rockies and diversify into residential choice markets.\n\nIn 2012, to add to its midstream assets, CenterPoint Energy Field Services (CEFS), an indirect subsidiary of the company, acquired gathering and processing assets from Prism Gas Systems, a subsidiary of Martin Midstream Partners for $275 million. The assets include Prism's 50% stake in Texas-based Waskom Gas Processing Co. A CEFS subsidiary owns the other 50% stake in Waskom.  \u2013 less",

Bruton Smith has raced Sonic Automotive to the front of the pack of US auto dealers behind larger rivals, such as AutoNation and Penske Automotive. Founded with five dealerships in 1997, Sonic today owns about 120 new- and used-vehicle dealerships and about 25 collision repair centers in major markets in 15 states, including Texas, the Carolinas, Tennessee and Georgia. The company sells some 30 brands of cars and light trucks and offers vehicle financing. Chairman Smith, who runs Sonic Automotive with his son Scott, is also the majority owner of Speedway Motorsports, which operates more than half a dozen NASCAR auto racetracks.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nOverall, the company's revenues in 2011 accounted for some $7.8 billion versus around $3.6 billion in 2010. Net income came in at $77.6 million in 2011 compared to $95.9 million in 2010, a 15% decrease. In 2011 the impact of earthquakes and the tsunami that struck Japan disrupted the company's Japanese supply chain and vehicle production. Sonic's new vehicle revenues and gross margins were impacted, thus affecting net income. Sonics' new vehicle sales generated around $4.3 million (about 55% of revenues) in revenues in 2011; used vehicle sales accounted for some $2 million (around 25% of revenues), and the company's parts, service and collision segment accounted for around $1.2 million (some 15% of revenues) in revenues.\n\nOperations\n\nIn 2011 the company sold approximately 12.7 million new vehicles compared to 11.6 million vehicles sold in 2010, a year-over-year increase of some 10%. The company sells new vehicles, including luxury (BMW, Lexus, Land Rover, and Volvo), mid-line import (Honda, Nissan, and Toyota), and domestic brands (Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors). Its luxury brands generated some 50% of revenues in 2011; while the company's mid-line and domestic brands accounted for about 35% and 15%, respectively.\n\nStrategy\n\nAs part of the company's strategic plans, Sonic is primarily focused in growing its operations in metropolitan markets in the Southeast, Southwest, Midwest, and the West (California). The company's long-term growth strategy is to target luxury or mid-line import brands.\n\nOwnership\n\nThe Smiths control the company through their ownership of about 75% of Sonic Automotive's voting stock. \u2013 less",

            "description": "Independent oil and gas producer Devon Energy puts its energy into oil and gas fields far from England's southwestern coast, in North America. It focuses on exploration and production assets in Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming, and western Canada. In 2011 Devon Energy reported proved reserves of 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent (58% natural gas) and more than 19,900 net acres of assets. It also drilled almost 2,500 gross wells. Devon Energy produces about 2.5 billion cu. ft. of natural gas a day (more than 3% of all the gas consumed in North America). The company is the largest producer and lease holder in the Barnett Shale (Texas) and is looking to replicate its success there to other unconventional plays.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nOnce active in major oil patches worldwide such as Azerbaijan, Brazil, and China, in the mid-2000s the company decided to focus on safer and increasingly productive unconventional onshore exploration opportunities (shales and oil sands) in North America. As a result, Devon Energy has sold all of its international assets.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nDevon Energy posted a major improvement in revenues in 2010, thanks to higher commodity prices and an increase in production. In 2011, buoyed by record level reserves, high oil prices, and an increased demand for oil and gas products, the company posted a further 15% growth in revenues. Net income only rose by 3%, however, as higher operating, depreciation, deletion, and amortization costs and an increase in deferred income tax expense trimmed income growth.\n\nBoosting its financial resources, in 2012 Devon Energy secured a commitment from Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration & Production for the Chinese company to invest $2.2 billion in exchange for one-third of Devon's interest in five new joint venture plays in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, Niobrara, Mississippian, Ohio Utica Shale, and the Michigan Basin.\n\nThat year it also closed a similar $1.4 billion joint venture deal with Sumitomo Corp. to develop 650,000 net acres in the Cline Shale and the Midland-Wolfcamp Shale in West Texas.\n\nStrategy\n\nIn 2010 it sold most of its remaining international assets to BP for $7 billion. As part of this deal BP sold undeveloped oil sand leases in Canada to Devon Energy for $500 million and formed a joint venture with the company to exploit them. The company also sold its Panyu field, offshore China, to China National Offshore Oil for $515 million.\n\nConsolidating its North American assets to just its onshore properties, In 2010 Devon Energy sold its stakes in the Cascade, Jack and St. Malo fields in the Gulf of Mexico (about 200 million barrels of estimated recoverable reserves) to AP Moller-Maersk's oil unit for $1.3 billion. It also sold its remaining Gulf of Mexico shelf assets to Apache for $1 billion. \u2013 less",

CenterPoint Energy's regulated utilities distribute natural gas to 3.3 million customers in six US states and electricity to more than 2 million customers on the Texas Gulf Coast. The company's main stomping ground is Texas, where it has regulated power distribution operations through subsidiary CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric. CenterPoint Energy operates more than 48,230 miles of power distribution lines, 8,000 miles of interstate gas pipeline, and 3,800 miles of gas gathering pipeline. It also provides natural gas field services. \n\nOperations\n\nThe company's natural gas distribution subsidiaries serve customers in Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas. (Texas represented 47% of all natural gas distribution customers in 2010). CenterPoint Energy also markets natural gas and related services to 12,200 commercial, industrial, and wholesale customers located primarily in the eastern US. It also provides HVAC and other energy-related services through its gas division.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nCenterPoint Energy's sales dropped dramatically in 2009 as the global recession prompted a slump in commodity prices which hurt the performance of its different energy segments. A reviving economy in 2010 led to a stronger demand for power and gas (coupled with rate increases and weather-related spikes in consumption) resulting in a overall jump in revenues and net income that year.\n\nStrategy\n\nCenterPoint Energy's strategy is focused on enhancing and expanding existing core operations, while acquiring complementary and synergistic businesses. In 2011 the company acquired Denver-based natural gas marketing firm Asgard Energy, which supplies gas to agricultural, commercial, industrial, and residential customers in five states (Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, and West Virginia). The acquisition fit into CenterPoint's strategy to expand into the Rockies and diversify into residential choice markets.\n\nIn 2012, to add to its midstream assets, CenterPoint Energy Field Services (CEFS), an indirect subsidiary of the company, acquired gathering and processing assets from Prism Gas Systems, a subsidiary of Martin Midstream Partners for $275 million. The assets include Prism's 50% stake in Texas-based Waskom Gas Processing Co. A CEFS subsidiary owns the other 50% stake in Waskom.  \u2013 less",

            "description": "While the breaching whale logo used by Pacific Life Insurance evokes the West Coast, the company operates all across the US. As the primary operating subsidiary of Pacific Mutual Holding Company, Pacific Life offers a wide range of life insurance, asset management, and financial services products, including individual annuities and mutual funds. It also offers a variety of investment products and services for individuals, businesses, and pension plans. Subsidiary Pacific Life & Annuity offers the same mix of life insurance and investment products and services for individuals and businesses in New York. Pacific Life was founded in 1868.\n\nOperations\n\nPacific Life policyholders are members of parent Pacific Mutual Holding Company, which was created in 1997 following a conversion to the mutual holding company structure. Pacific LifeCorp is the intermediate stock holding company.\n\nWhile life insurance is the company's bread and butter, it has brought in other operations for variety. Pacific Life's Aviation Capital Group subsidiary leases commercial jets to 90 airlines in more than 40 countries. It also manages aircraft assets for third parties such as commercial airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and financial institutions. Other subsidiaries include Pacific Asset Management, which provides third-party institutional asset management.\n\nSales & Marketing\n\nPacific Life's insurance policies are sold through independent distributors and through dealer/broker subsidiary Pacific Select Distributors.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nThe company's growth strategies helped Pacific Life achieve strong results in 2011, with revenues increasing 15% over 2010 to almost 6.7 billion, and net income increasing 29% to $679 million. Its operating income climbed a whopping 40% over 2010 to reach $823 million. The gains achieved were attributed to enhanced service offerings, expanded life insurance, annuity, and mutual fund product offerings, and the two acquisitions made that year.\n\nStrategy\n\nBeing a mutual company, Pacific Life operates with a long-term focus to serve in the best interests of its policyholders and clients. in doing so, the company navigated the chilly economic waters of the 2008-2009 recession by steadily introducing new products and building up its capital reserves. By 2010 its net income had grown as risk-weary customers squirreled more of their savings and retirement monies into life insurance and mutual funds.\n\nMergers, Acquisitions & Divestitures\n\nIn 2008 the company added international reinsurance to its portfolio when it acquired the former London-based specialty reinsurance operations of Scottish Re and renamed the business as Pacific Life Re. It then added life retrocession (reinsurance of a reinsurer) to its line-up in 2011 by acquiring that business from Manulife and expanded its business to include the Toronto, Boston, Barbados, and Cologne markets.\n\nAlso in 2011 Pacific life bought JPMorgan Chase's pension risk advisory business to form Pacific Global Advisors. The unit offers risk management solutions and advisory services to pension plan sponsors.\n\nThe firm divested a noncore business, College Savings Bank, in 2012 to a syndicate of investors for an undisclosed price. The banking unit managed two state-sponsored 529 college savings plans. \u2013 less",

CenterPoint Energy's regulated utilities distribute natural gas to 3.3 million customers in six US states and electricity to more than 2 million customers on the Texas Gulf Coast. The company's main stomping ground is Texas, where it has regulated power distribution operations through subsidiary CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric. CenterPoint Energy operates more than 48,230 miles of power distribution lines, 8,000 miles of interstate gas pipeline, and 3,800 miles of gas gathering pipeline. It also provides natural gas field services. \n\nOperations\n\nThe company's natural gas distribution subsidiaries serve customers in Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas. (Texas represented 47% of all natural gas distribution customers in 2010). CenterPoint Energy also markets natural gas and related services to 12,200 commercial, industrial, and wholesale customers located primarily in the eastern US. It also provides HVAC and other energy-related services through its gas division.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nCenterPoint Energy's sales dropped dramatically in 2009 as the global recession prompted a slump in commodity prices which hurt the performance of its different energy segments. A reviving economy in 2010 led to a stronger demand for power and gas (coupled with rate increases and weather-related spikes in consumption) resulting in a overall jump in revenues and net income that year.\n\nStrategy\n\nCenterPoint Energy's strategy is focused on enhancing and expanding existing core operations, while acquiring complementary and synergistic businesses. In 2011 the company acquired Denver-based natural gas marketing firm Asgard Energy, which supplies gas to agricultural, commercial, industrial, and residential customers in five states (Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, and West Virginia). The acquisition fit into CenterPoint's strategy to expand into the Rockies and diversify into residential choice markets.\n\nIn 2012, to add to its midstream assets, CenterPoint Energy Field Services (CEFS), an indirect subsidiary of the company, acquired gathering and processing assets from Prism Gas Systems, a subsidiary of Martin Midstream Partners for $275 million. The assets include Prism's 50% stake in Texas-based Waskom Gas Processing Co. A CEFS subsidiary owns the other 50% stake in Waskom.  \u2013 less",

The bank is primarily active in the UK, where it has some 1,700 branches, but also has significant retail and commercial operations in Europe, Africa (it owns more than half of South African bank Absa Group), the Middle East, and the US. Barclays Bank offers standard retail services such as deposit accounts and lending, including Woolwich-brand mortgages. The bank also provides commercial money transfer services, insurance products, the Barclaycard line of credit cards, and financial advisory services. Barclays Bank traces its roots to the late 17th century.\n\nBarclays Bank has been building up its portfolio of global credit card accounts, especially as other financial groups sell off noncore units during the economic recovery. In 2010 the company acquired the Italian credit card accounts of Citigroup in a deal that included some 197,000 card accounts and approximately \u20ac234 million ($320 million) worth of assets. It previously bought Goldfish, the struggling UK credit card unit of Discover Financial Services, for some \u00a346 million ($70 million). In 2011 Barclays acquired Egg UK's credit card portfolio, which added more than 1 million accounts; it has agreed to buy more Citibank card accounts.\n\nThe bank has also been offloading some of its own holdings as part of an overall corporate restructuring. In 2010 Barclays sold its US subprime loan servicing business, HomEq Servicing, to Ocwen Financial. It also announced plans to abandon retail banking in certain international markets and instead focus on wholesale and commercial banking. In 2011 it shuttered its Indonesian retail unit Bank Akita, which it had acquired only two years before. The company also sold its Russian retail and commercial operations to a group of investors, citing difficulties competing in the market. Barclays will instead focus on its investment banking activities in the region.\n\nIn 2010 Barclays acquired Standard Life Bank from Standard Life for \u00a3226 million ($369 million). The deal added Standard Life's savings and mortgage books to the Barclays fold. Also as part of the deal, Barclays and Standard Life entered into a partnership whereby Barclays markets pension products to its clients.\n\nDespite challenges in the economy, especially in regards to Europe's debt problems, Barclays Bank's revenues grew 8% in 2011. Its Africa business performed relatively strongly, with credit impairments improving, as did Barclaycard, thanks to the portfolio acquisitions which delivered profits. That year the bank closed nearly 150 European branches (largely located in Spain), the costs of which contributed to a 5% decline in net income. \u2013 less",

The company offers financial planning, products, and services to individual and institutional investors. Through Ameriprise Financial, Columbia Management, RiverSource, and other affiliates and brands, the company provides access to insurance, mutual funds, savings plans, personal trust services, retail brokerage, and other financial products and services. Its Ameriprise Bank subsidiary offers deposits and loans. Ameriprise, which has about $630 billion of assets under management, distributes its products primarily through a network of more than 9,700 financial advisors.\n\nThe company has been sharpening its focus on its branded adviser network. It sold its Securities America independent broker-dealer subsidiary to Ladenburg Thalmann for some $150 million in 2011. Shortly before the sale of the troubled unit, Ameriprise agreed to pay $160 million to settle claims that Securities America brokers sold securities in fraudulent companies.\n\nAmeriprise has been steadily boosting its assets under management and growing its client base (focusing on the affluent and mass affluent with at least $100,000 in investable assets). The company also is focused on geographic areas where those clients are congregated and has closed or consolidated offices in areas with less potential. While Columbia Management covers Ameriprise's main asset management market in the US, the company is increasing its global presence through its Threadneedle brand overseas. Ameriprise plans to grow its asset management operations in Europe, as well as in Australia, the Middle East, and Asia.\n\nAmeriprise's strategies have paid off. Volatile financial market conditions, which negatively impacted all of the company's operations, led to a decline in revenue in 2008 and 2009. However, the company returned to success in 2010 and revenues grew by more than 20% that year. Poor economic conditions continued in 2011. However, Ameriprise's operating net revenues climbed that year by about 10%. The boost was due to strong growth in the company's fee-based advisory and asset management businesses.\n\nAmeriprise Financial, which was founded in 1894, was spun off from American Express in 2005. \u2013 less",

It also engages in natural gas compressing, treating, processing, transporting, and selling. DCP Midstream LLC also transports and sells NGLs and distributes propane wholesale. The company operates natural gas gathering systems (5,300 miles of pipe) in eight states (including Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas), seven processing plants, four NGL pipelines, and nine propane storage terminals. Spectra Energy holds a 50% holding in DCP (ConocoPhillips holds the other 50%).\n\nA consolidator in the fragmented natural gas gathering, NGLs, and wholesale propane industry segments, the company has been expanding its gas supply base and its propane wholesale network in recent years through strategic complementary acquisitions and joint ventures.\n\nIn 2012 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Texas-based Crossroads processing plant and gathering system from Penn Virginia Resource Partners for $63 million. The bolt-on acquisition allows the company to expand its market position in East Texas and provide services to drillers in the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley regions.\n\nIn 2011 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Seaway Products Pipeline Co. from ConocoPhillips. The pipeline, now called Southern Hills Pipeline and being converted to NGL service, is expected to be operational by mid-2013. It will provide NGL access from the Midcontinent to the Texas Gulf Coast.\n\nThe company agreed to form a joint venture with EQT Corporation to develop natural gas processing and related natural gas liquid (NGL) infrastructure in the Marcellus and Huron shale plays in the Appalachian basin. (However, the parties could not come to agreement and dropped the plan in early 2011). In 2010, the company acquired the Liberty gathering system and south Raywood processing plant from Ceritas Energy in southeast Texas. The pipeline system interconnects with DCP Midstream's Centana Intrastate Pipeline system.\n\nExpanding in Michigan, in 2009 the company acquired gas gathering and treating assets for $45.1 million. In 2010 it acquired a 350-mile interstate natural gas liquids pipeline system in Colorado's Denver-Julesburg Basin from Buckeye Partners for $22 million.\n\nIn 2010 DCP Midstream Partners moved to extend its Northeast wholesale propane business into the MidAtlantic region, acquiring UGI's Atlantic Energy for $49 million. That year it also purchased of NGL storage company Marysville Hydrocarbon Holdings (in Michigan) for about $95 million.\n\nAlthough DCP Midstream Partners' revenues suffered in 2009 as a result of the global recession and lower commodity prices, acquisitions and organic growth managed to offset lower natural gas volumes.  Acquisitions, increased demand, higher commodity and propane prices, and gains on derivatives help to lift the company's revenues and net income in 2010.\n\nIn terms of the company's origins, the D in DCP Midstream Partners (formerly Duke Energy Field Services) is for Duke Energy; the CP, ConocoPhillips. These two energy majors formed DCP Midstream Partners in 2005. Following the spinoff of Spectra Energy from Duke Energy in 2007, Spectra Energy assumed Duke Energy's 50% holding in DCP. \u2013 less",

The company's main stomping ground is Texas, where it has regulated power distribution operations through subsidiary CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric. CenterPoint Energy operates more than 48,230 miles of power distribution lines, 8,000 miles of interstate gas pipeline, and 3,800 miles of gas gathering pipeline. It also provides natural gas field services. \n\nOperations\n\nThe company's natural gas distribution subsidiaries serve customers in Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas. (Texas represented 47% of all natural gas distribution customers in 2010). CenterPoint Energy also markets natural gas and related services to 12,200 commercial, industrial, and wholesale customers located primarily in the eastern US. It also provides HVAC and other energy-related services through its gas division.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nCenterPoint Energy's sales dropped dramatically in 2009 as the global recession prompted a slump in commodity prices which hurt the performance of its different energy segments. A reviving economy in 2010 led to a stronger demand for power and gas (coupled with rate increases and weather-related spikes in consumption) resulting in a overall jump in revenues and net income that year.\n\nStrategy\n\nCenterPoint Energy's strategy is focused on enhancing and expanding existing core operations, while acquiring complementary and synergistic businesses. In 2011 the company acquired Denver-based natural gas marketing firm Asgard Energy, which supplies gas to agricultural, commercial, industrial, and residential customers in five states (Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, and West Virginia). The acquisition fit into CenterPoint's strategy to expand into the Rockies and diversify into residential choice markets.\n\nIn 2012, to add to its midstream assets, CenterPoint Energy Field Services (CEFS), an indirect subsidiary of the company, acquired gathering and processing assets from Prism Gas Systems, a subsidiary of Martin Midstream Partners for $275 million.

Auto-Owners Insurance Group operates through subsidiaries including Auto-Owners Life Insurance, Home-Owners Insurance, and Property-Owners Insurance Company. Its Southern-Owners Insurance subsidiary offers property/casualty insurance in Florida. Auto-Owners Insurance also sells commercial auto, liability, and workers' compensation policies. Established in 1916, the company operates in 26 states nationwide and is represented by more than 6,000 independent agencies.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nAuto-Owners operates 85 claims, underwriting, and marketing offices in its 26-state service territory. The company's largest markets are Florida and Michigan.\n\nOperations\n\nAuto-Owners' revenues come from insurance premiums, as well as investment income. The company's property/casualty business accounts for about 90% of revenues and 80% of profits, with the remainder coming from premiums and income from the life insurance segment.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nAuto-Owners reported a 5% increase in net written premiums in 2011 to nearly $5.2 billion, primarily due to growth within the Auto-Owners Insurance, Auto-Owners Life, and Home-Owners Insurance divisions. Total revenues were some $5.7 billion, while net income was reported at $69 million.\n\nStrategy\n\nAuto-Owners is focused on growing its business by establishing strong relationships with independent agents and by diversifying its product offerings. The company has also expanded by adding sales and service facilities in new and existing markets. In 2011 Auto-Owners opened five new branch locations to handle claims in Ashville, North Carolina; Kennesaw, Georgia; Little Rock, Arkansas; Madison, Wisconsin; and Sioux Falls, South Dakota. The Little Rock location also provides underwriting. New construction that year included a backup data center in Traverse City, Michigan, and offices in Broomfield, Colorado, and Columbia, Missouri, to replace existing branches. \u2013 less",

The company offers financial planning, products, and services to individual and institutional investors. Through Ameriprise Financial, Columbia Management, RiverSource, and other affiliates and brands, the company provides access to insurance, mutual funds, savings plans, personal trust services, retail brokerage, and other financial products and services. Its Ameriprise Bank subsidiary offers deposits and loans. Ameriprise, which has about $630 billion of assets under management, distributes its products primarily through a network of more than 9,700 financial advisors.\n\nThe company has been sharpening its focus on its branded adviser network. It sold its Securities America independent broker-dealer subsidiary to Ladenburg Thalmann for some $150 million in 2011. Shortly before the sale of the troubled unit, Ameriprise agreed to pay $160 million to settle claims that Securities America brokers sold securities in fraudulent companies.\n\nAmeriprise has been steadily boosting its assets under management and growing its client base (focusing on the affluent and mass affluent with at least $100,000 in investable assets). The company also is focused on geographic areas where those clients are congregated and has closed or consolidated offices in areas with less potential. While Columbia Management covers Ameriprise's main asset management market in the US, the company is increasing its global presence through its Threadneedle brand overseas. Ameriprise plans to grow its asset management operations in Europe, as well as in Australia, the Middle East, and Asia.\n\nAmeriprise's strategies have paid off. Volatile financial market conditions, which negatively impacted all of the company's operations, led to a decline in revenue in 2008 and 2009. However, the company returned to success in 2010 and revenues grew by more than 20% that year. Poor economic conditions continued in 2011. However, Ameriprise's operating net revenues climbed that year by about 10%. The boost was due to strong growth in the company's fee-based advisory and asset management businesses.\n\nAmeriprise Financial, which was founded in 1894, was spun off from American Express in 2005. \u2013 less",

We are based in Glendale, California.\n\nThe Avery Dennison story begins in 1935, with just a few spare parts, one very bright idea and a $100 loan.\n\nRay Stanton (\u201cStan\u201d) Avery, a struggling clerk in Los Angeles, invented a smarter way for stores to price their products, then went on to pioneer the labeling industry.\n\nWith a few simple materials\u2014primarily used machine parts and a saber saw\u2014Stan created and patented the first self-adhesive, die-cut labeling machine. His practical genius would ultimately yield eighteen patents and establish Avery Adhesives as the company that transformed how brands and businesses deliver information.

            "description": "While the breaching whale logo used by Pacific Life Insurance evokes the West Coast, the company operates all across the US. As the primary operating subsidiary of Pacific Mutual Holding Company, Pacific Life offers a wide range of life insurance, asset management, and financial services products, including individual annuities and mutual funds. It also offers a variety of investment products and services for individuals, businesses, and pension plans. Subsidiary Pacific Life & Annuity offers the same mix of life insurance and investment products and services for individuals and businesses in New York. Pacific Life was founded in 1868.\n\nOperations\n\nPacific Life policyholders are members of parent Pacific Mutual Holding Company, which was created in 1997 following a conversion to the mutual holding company structure. Pacific LifeCorp is the intermediate stock holding company.\n\nWhile life insurance is the company's bread and butter, it has brought in other operations for variety. Pacific Life's Aviation Capital Group subsidiary leases commercial jets to 90 airlines in more than 40 countries. It also manages aircraft assets for third parties such as commercial airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and financial institutions. Other subsidiaries include Pacific Asset Management, which provides third-party institutional asset management.\n\nSales & Marketing\n\nPacific Life's insurance policies are sold through independent distributors and through dealer/broker subsidiary Pacific Select Distributors.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nThe company's growth strategies helped Pacific Life achieve strong results in 2011, with revenues increasing 15% over 2010 to almost 6.7 billion, and net income increasing 29% to $679 million. Its operating income climbed a whopping 40% over 2010 to reach $823 million. The gains achieved were attributed to enhanced service offerings, expanded life insurance, annuity, and mutual fund product offerings, and the two acquisitions made that year.\n\nStrategy\n\nBeing a mutual company, Pacific Life operates with a long-term focus to serve in the best interests of its policyholders and clients. in doing so, the company navigated the chilly economic waters of the 2008-2009 recession by steadily introducing new products and building up its capital reserves. By 2010 its net income had grown as risk-weary customers squirreled more of their savings and retirement monies into life insurance and mutual funds.\n\nMergers, Acquisitions & Divestitures\n\nIn 2008 the company added international reinsurance to its portfolio when it acquired the former London-based specialty reinsurance operations of Scottish Re and renamed the business as Pacific Life Re. It then added life retrocession (reinsurance of a reinsurer) to its line-up in 2011 by acquiring that business from Manulife and expanded its business to include the Toronto, Boston, Barbados, and Cologne markets.\n\nAlso in 2011 Pacific life bought JPMorgan Chase's pension risk advisory business to form Pacific Global Advisors. The unit offers risk management solutions and advisory services to pension plan sponsors.\n\nThe firm divested a noncore business, College Savings Bank, in 2012 to a syndicate of investors for an undisclosed price. The banking unit managed two state-sponsored 529 college savings plans. \u2013 less",

The company's primary operations include the manufacture of building block chemicals like acetic acid and vinyl acetate monomers. Those chemicals are used in everything from inks and paints to agricultural products and chewing gum. Canadian subsidiary Acetex, the majority of whose sales come from Europe, is the world's largest acetyls manufacturer. Other products include acetate tow (in cigarette filters); industrial specialties like ethylene vinyl aceta; and engineered plastics. The bulk of sales come from the US and Germany. \n\nOperations\n\nCelanese operates through four business segments: Advanced Engineered Materials, Consumer Specialties, Industrial Specialties, and Acetyl Intermediates. The company is one of the world's largest producers of acetyl products, as well as a top global producer of engineered polymers.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nIn addition to manufacturing sites in the US, it also has properties, plants, and equipment in Belgium, China, Canada, Germany, Mexico, and Singapore.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nCelanese continued its recovery from the recession of 2008-09 with a 14% increase in revenues in 2011, due primarily to higher volumes and increased sales prices across most of its business segments. The largest gains were in its Industrial Specialties unit (up 18%), Advanced Engineered Materials unit (up 17%), and its Acetyl Intermediates segment (up 15%). Net income grew by 61% in 2011, as increased revenues outpaced a more modest growth in operating expenses.\n\nStrategy\n\nCelanese's strategy is to grow the company through expansion into emerging regions, particularly China; to offer innovation through developing new products and applications; increase its productivity through energy reduction, business process improvements, and manufacturing optimization; and boost its portfolio by growing its business through both acquisitions or internal growth.\n\nIn 2012 the company teamed up with Indonesia's Pertamina, forming a joint venture to develop fuel ethanol projects in that country.\n\nTo grow its emulsion polymers business, in 2011 the company acquired two product lines, Vinac and Flexbond, from Ashland. The acquisition is expected to speed up growth of the company's emulsion polymers operations throughout the Americas -- especially in the adhesives, textiles, coatings, and paper segments.\n\nCelanese subsidiary Ticona Engineering Polymers acquired two product lines, Zenite liquid crystal polymer and Thermx polycyclohexylene-dimethylene terephthalate, from DuPont Performance Polymers division in 2010. The units expanded Celanese's offerings in the electrical and electronics application segments of the global polymers market. \n\nOwnership\n\nIn 2012 Capital Research Global Investors owned about 11% of Celanese, with several other investment firms owning a smaller stakes.\n\nCompany Background\n\nCelanese Corporation was created in 2004 by the Blackstone Group, which had acquired a majority share in Celanese AG, turned it private, and then flipped it in a 2005 public offering. Blackstone finally divested its remaining holdings in Celanese in 2007. \u2013 less",

We are based in Glendale, California.\n\nThe Avery Dennison story begins in 1935, with just a few spare parts, one very bright idea and a $100 loan.\n\nRay Stanton (\u201cStan\u201d) Avery, a struggling clerk in Los Angeles, invented a smarter way for stores to price their products, then went on to pioneer the labeling industry.\n\nWith a few simple materials\u2014primarily used machine parts and a saber saw\u2014Stan created and patented the first self-adhesive, die-cut labeling machine. His practical genius would ultimately yield eighteen patents and establish Avery Adhesives as the company that transformed how brands and businesses deliver information. In 1990, Avery International merged with Dennison Manufacturing to become Avery Dennison.\n\nToday, we manufacture and distribute labeling and packaging materials in over 50 countries and employ more than 25,000 people. The flexibility and responsiveness afforded by our company's global footprint enables us to service our customers at key points throughout their supply chain.\n\nIn just over 80 years we have grown from one bright idea into a global corporation that continues to set new standards for quality and innovation in materials science.\n\nAvery Dennison manufactures and distributes display graphics, labeling and packaging materials, retail graphic embellishments and RFID tags that companies around the world use to engage customers and efficiently manage their inventories. Our products are virtually everywhere you look, providing a crucial thread in the fabric of global commerce.\n\nWe sustain Stan Avery's spirit of curiosity through research, invention and development of new materials science products and processes. Our expertise in high-speed manufacturing, information display and management, logistics, branding, graphics and packaging enables us to impact a wide array of markets\u2014from consumer packaged goods and apparel to transportation, architecture and healthcare.\n\nWe strive to make each customer's brand more inspiring and every process more intelligent.\n\nAvery Dennison's extensive experience in our core businesses allows us to purchase, process, and deliver needed materials to key points in our customers' supply chains with rapid and globally consistent execution.\n\nIn the 21st century, the company will expand its footprint in emerging markets.\n\nThe pursuit of this vision has compelled us to align our businesses into a focused, customer-driven company that specializes in materials science. Our in-depth pool of expertise and global scale enable us to deliver insights, innovative products and intelligent solutions to customers all over the world. \u2013 less",

            "description": "Ameren provides the power that makes much of the American Midwest run. The holding company distributes electricity to 2.4 million customers and natural gas to 900,000 customers in Missouri and Illinois through utility subsidiaries. Ameren has a generating capacity of 16,000 MW (primarily coal-fired), most of which is controlled by utility Union Electric (which does business as Ameren Missouri) and nonregulated subsidiary AmerenEnergy Resources Generating Company. Ameren, which also supplies merchant generation power to third parties, operates a nuclear power facility, three hydroelectric plants, and several coal-fired plants and turbine combustion facilities. It also purchases power, including windpower.\n\nOperations\n\nIn addition to operating power plants, Ameren procures natural gas for its affiliated companies, builds new power plants, and provides long-term energy supply contracts. It also markets and trades electricity to wholesale and retail customers and provides risk management and other energy-related services.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nAmeren's overall revenues dipped in 2011. While increased rates helped to lift Ameren Missouri's revenues in 2011, Ameren Illinois' regulated segment and the merchant generation segment both reported a drop in revenues. In particular, low gas prices and a warm winter hurt gas revenues. However, lower purchased power and resale gas, coupled with a drop in goodwill, impairment, and other charges, helped to lift Ameren's net income for the year.\n\nFavorable weather conditions (which increased energy demand) and rate increases help to lift the company's revenues in 2010. However, impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets in the merchant generation segment (due to the sustained decline in market prices for electricity) dragged down Ameren's operating income.\n\nStrategy\n\nIn 2010 the company combined AmerenIP, AmerenCIPS, and AmerenCILCO into one entity, Ameren Illinois, in order to streamline operations and reduce confusion among customers. The three Illinois utilities have operated as a single business since 2004 and deliver energy to more than 1,100 communities. Ameren Illinois also operates some 21,400 miles of natural gas distribution and transmission lines.\n\nTo comply with federal requirements to separate ownership of power generation and transmission businesses, the operations of Ameren subsidiaries' transmission assets are under the control ofMidwest Independent Transmission System Operator, a regional transmission organization that coordinates power across 15 Midwestern states and one Canadian Province.  \u2013 less",

            "description": "Celanese Corporation gets a lot of good ink about its acetates. The company's primary operations include the manufacture of building block chemicals like acetic acid and vinyl acetate monomers. Those chemicals are used in everything from inks and paints to agricultural products and chewing gum. Canadian subsidiary Acetex, the majority of whose sales come from Europe, is the world's largest acetyls manufacturer. Other products include acetate tow (in cigarette filters); industrial specialties like ethylene vinyl aceta; and engineered plastics. The bulk of sales come from the US and Germany. \n\nOperations\n\nCelanese operates through four business segments: Advanced Engineered Materials, Consumer Specialties, Industrial Specialties, and Acetyl Intermediates. The company is one of the world's largest producers of acetyl products, as well as a top global producer of engineered polymers.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nIn addition to manufacturing sites in the US, it also has properties, plants, and equipment in Belgium, China, Canada, Germany, Mexico, and Singapore.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nCelanese continued its recovery from the recession of 2008-09 with a 14% increase in revenues in 2011, due primarily to higher volumes and increased sales prices across most of its business segments. The largest gains were in its Industrial Specialties unit (up 18%), Advanced Engineered Materials unit (up 17%), and its Acetyl Intermediates segment (up 15%). Net income grew by 61% in 2011, as increased revenues outpaced a more modest growth in operating expenses.\n\nStrategy\n\nCelanese's strategy is to grow the company through expansion into emerging regions, particularly China; to offer innovation through developing new products and applications; increase its productivity through energy reduction, business process improvements, and manufacturing optimization; and boost its portfolio by growing its business through both acquisitions or internal growth.\n\nIn 2012 the company teamed up with Indonesia's Pertamina, forming a joint venture to develop fuel ethanol projects in that country.\n\nTo grow its emulsion polymers business, in 2011 the company acquired two product lines, Vinac and Flexbond, from Ashland. The acquisition is expected to speed up growth of the company's emulsion polymers operations throughout the Americas -- especially in the adhesives, textiles, coatings, and paper segments.\n\nCelanese subsidiary Ticona Engineering Polymers acquired two product lines, Zenite liquid crystal polymer and Thermx polycyclohexylene-dimethylene terephthalate, from DuPont Performance Polymers division in 2010. The units expanded Celanese's offerings in the electrical and electronics application segments of the global polymers market. \n\nOwnership\n\nIn 2012 Capital Research Global Investors owned about 11% of Celanese, with several other investment firms owning a smaller stakes.\n\nCompany Background\n\nCelanese Corporation was created in 2004 by the Blackstone Group, which had acquired a majority share in Celanese AG, turned it private, and then flipped it in a 2005 public offering. Blackstone finally divested its remaining holdings in Celanese in 2007. \u2013 less",

As the primary operating subsidiary of Pacific Mutual Holding Company, Pacific Life offers a wide range of life insurance, asset management, and financial services products, including individual annuities and mutual funds. It also offers a variety of investment products and services for individuals, businesses, and pension plans. Subsidiary Pacific Life & Annuity offers the same mix of life insurance and investment products and services for individuals and businesses in New York. Pacific Life was founded in 1868.\n\nOperations\n\nPacific Life policyholders are members of parent Pacific Mutual Holding Company, which was created in 1997 following a conversion to the mutual holding company structure. Pacific LifeCorp is the intermediate stock holding company.\n\nWhile life insurance is the company's bread and butter, it has brought in other operations for variety. Pacific Life's Aviation Capital Group subsidiary leases commercial jets to 90 airlines in more than 40 countries. It also manages aircraft assets for third parties such as commercial airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and financial institutions. Other subsidiaries include Pacific Asset Management, which provides third-party institutional asset management.\n\nSales & Marketing\n\nPacific Life's insurance policies are sold through independent distributors and through dealer/broker subsidiary Pacific Select Distributors.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nThe company's growth strategies helped Pacific Life achieve strong results in 2011, with revenues increasing 15% over 2010 to almost 6.7 billion, and net income increasing 29% to $679 million. Its operating income climbed a whopping 40% over 2010 to reach $823 million. The gains achieved were attributed to enhanced service offerings, expanded life insurance, annuity, and mutual fund product offerings, and the two acquisitions made that year.\n\nStrategy\n\nBeing a mutual company, Pacific Life operates with a long-term focus to serve in the best interests of its policyholders and clients. in doing so, the company navigated the chilly economic waters of the 2008-2009 recession by steadily introducing new products and building up its capital reserves. By 2010 its net income had grown as risk-weary customers squirreled more of their savings and retirement monies into life insurance and mutual funds.\n\nMergers, Acquisitions & Divestitures\n\nIn 2008 the company added international reinsurance to its portfolio when it acquired the former London-based specialty reinsurance operations of Scottish Re and renamed the business as Pacific Life Re. It then added life retrocession (reinsurance of a reinsurer) to its line-up in 2011 by acquiring that business from Manulife and expanded its business to include the Toronto, Boston, Barbados, and Cologne markets.\n\nAlso in 2011 Pacific life bought JPMorgan Chase's pension risk advisory business to form Pacific Global Advisors. The unit offers risk management solutions and advisory services to pension plan sponsors.\n\nThe firm divested a noncore business, College Savings Bank, in 2012 to a syndicate of investors for an undisclosed price. The banking unit managed two state-sponsored 529 college savings plans. \u2013 less",

The utility has a net generating capacity of about 19,200 MW from interests in fossil-fueled, nuclear, and hydroelectric power plants. Duke Energy Carolinas also sells power to wholesale customers.\n\nThe utility's three nuclear plants account for more than a quarter of Duke Energy Carolinas' generating capacity.\n\nDuke Energy Carolinas is investing $7 billion from 2010 to 2012 to expand its generating capacity and maintain its nuclear fuel and plants. By 2020 the company is looking to expand capacity by 5,400 MW, a strategy that brings new plants online while replacing older, less efficient ones.\n\nThe global recession produced weaker demand for power (especially from industrial customers) which lowered company revenues in 2009. However, the same downturn cut fuel expenses (including purchased power from third parties) resulting in only a slight dip in Duke Energy Carolinas' operating income.\n\nIn 2010 the company saw its revenues rise, primarily due to new retail electric base rates in North Carolina and South Carolina, and favorable weather conditions which spurred demand. Duke Energy Carolinas also posted higher net income, despite an increase in fuel costs and expenses related to an employee voluntary severance plan. \u2013 less",

The warehouses are designed to help small-to-medium-sized businesses reduce costs in purchasing for resale and for everyday business use. Individuals may also purchase for their personal needs.\n\nCostco's warehouses present one of the largest and most exclusive product category selections to be found under a single roof. Categories include groceries, confectionary, appliances, television and media, automotive supplies, tyres, toys, hardware, sporting goods, jewellery, watches, cameras, books, housewares, apparel, health and beauty aids, tobacco, furniture, office supplies and office equipment. Costco is known for carrying top quality national and regional brands, at prices consistently below traditional wholesale or retail outlets. Members can also shop for private label Kirkland Signature products, designed to be of equal or better quality than national brands, including juice, cookies, coffee, tyres, housewares, luggage, appliances, clothing and detergent.\n\nAccording to Jim Sinegal, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, \"Costco is able to offer lower prices and better values by eliminating virtually all the frills and costs historically associated with conventional wholesalers and retailers, including salespeople, fancy buildings, delivery, billing and accounts receivable. We run a tight operation with extremely low overhead which enables us to pass on dramatic savings to our members.\"\n\nCostco offers two types of membership: Business and Gold Star. Business members qualify by owning or operating a business while Gold Star membership is available to individuals. All members get a free additional card. Costco warehouses are open seven days per week for all members.\n\nCostco opened the first Australian location at Docklands in August 2009 and is opening locations in Auburn, NSW and Canberra, ACT in July, 2011. \u2013 less",

The company offers financial planning, products, and services to individual and institutional investors. Through Ameriprise Financial, Columbia Management, RiverSource, and other affiliates and brands, the company provides access to insurance, mutual funds, savings plans, personal trust services, retail brokerage, and other financial products and services. Its Ameriprise Bank subsidiary offers deposits and loans. Ameriprise, which has about $630 billion of assets under management, distributes its products primarily through a network of more than 9,700 financial advisors.\n\nThe company has been sharpening its focus on its branded adviser network. It sold its Securities America independent broker-dealer subsidiary to Ladenburg Thalmann for some $150 million in 2011. Shortly before the sale of the troubled unit, Ameriprise agreed to pay $160 million to settle claims that Securities America brokers sold securities in fraudulent companies.\n\nAmeriprise has been steadily boosting its assets under management and growing its client base (focusing on the affluent and mass affluent with at least $100,000 in investable assets). The company also is focused on geographic areas where those clients are congregated and has closed or consolidated offices in areas with less potential. While Columbia Management covers Ameriprise's main asset management market in the US, the company is increasing its global presence through its Threadneedle brand overseas. Ameriprise plans to grow its asset management operations in Europe, as well as in Australia, the Middle East, and Asia.\n\nAmeriprise's strategies have paid off. Volatile financial market conditions, which negatively impacted all of the company's operations, led to a decline in revenue in 2008 and 2009. However, the company returned to success in 2010 and revenues grew by more than 20% that year. Poor economic conditions continued in 2011. However, Ameriprise's operating net revenues climbed that year by about 10%. The boost was due to strong growth in the company's fee-based advisory and asset management businesses.\n\nAmeriprise Financial, which was founded in 1894, was spun off from American Express in 2005. \u2013 less",

            "description": "While the breaching whale logo used by Pacific Life Insurance evokes the West Coast, the company operates all across the US. As the primary operating subsidiary of Pacific Mutual Holding Company, Pacific Life offers a wide range of life insurance, asset management, and financial services products, including individual annuities and mutual funds. It also offers a variety of investment products and services for individuals, businesses, and pension plans. Subsidiary Pacific Life & Annuity offers the same mix of life insurance and investment products and services for individuals and businesses in New York. Pacific Life was founded in 1868.\n\nOperations\n\nPacific Life policyholders are members of parent Pacific Mutual Holding Company, which was created in 1997 following a conversion to the mutual holding company structure. Pacific LifeCorp is the intermediate stock holding company.\n\nWhile life insurance is the company's bread and butter, it has brought in other operations for variety. Pacific Life's Aviation Capital Group subsidiary leases commercial jets to 90 airlines in more than 40 countries. It also manages aircraft assets for third parties such as commercial airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and financial institutions. Other subsidiaries include Pacific Asset Management, which provides third-party institutional asset management.\n\nSales & Marketing\n\nPacific Life's insurance policies are sold through independent distributors and through dealer/broker subsidiary Pacific Select Distributors.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nThe company's growth strategies helped Pacific Life achieve strong results in 2011, with revenues increasing 15% over 2010 to almost 6.7 billion, and net income increasing 29% to $679 million. Its operating income climbed a whopping 40% over 2010 to reach $823 million. The gains achieved were attributed to enhanced service offerings, expanded life insurance, annuity, and mutual fund product offerings, and the two acquisitions made that year.\n\nStrategy\n\nBeing a mutual company, Pacific Life operates with a long-term focus to serve in the best interests of its policyholders and clients. in doing so, the company navigated the chilly economic waters of the 2008-2009 recession by steadily introducing new products and building up its capital reserves. By 2010 its net income had grown as risk-weary customers squirreled more of their savings and retirement monies into life insurance and mutual funds.\n\nMergers, Acquisitions & Divestitures\n\nIn 2008 the company added international reinsurance to its portfolio when it acquired the former London-based specialty reinsurance operations of Scottish Re and renamed the business as Pacific Life Re. It then added life retrocession (reinsurance of a reinsurer) to its line-up in 2011 by acquiring that business from Manulife and expanded its business to include the Toronto, Boston, Barbados, and Cologne markets.\n\nAlso in 2011 Pacific life bought JPMorgan Chase's pension risk advisory business to form Pacific Global Advisors. The unit offers risk management solutions and advisory services to pension plan sponsors.\n\nThe firm divested a noncore business, College Savings Bank, in 2012 to a syndicate of investors for an undisclosed price. The banking unit managed two state-sponsored 529 college savings plans. \u2013 less",

            "description": "When it comes to data storage, Western Digital has drive. The company is one of the largest independent makers of hard-disk drives, which record, store, and recall volumes of data. Drives for PCs account for most of Western Digital's sales, although the company also makes devices used in servers, cloud computing data centers, and home entertainment products such as set-top boxes and video game consoles. The company sells to manufacturers and through retailers and distributors. More than 60% of its sales are to OEMs such as  Hewlett-Packard, which is Western Digital's largest customer. The company gets more than half of its sales from the Asia/Pacific region.\n\nOperations\n\nWestern Digital is structured around two subsidiaries: WD Technologies and Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST). Each subsidiary maintains its own brand and product lines, with separate sales, marketing, operations, and product development teams. The company is looking to offer improved customer experiences for competing and complementary brands, while finding efficiencies in shared services.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nThe company is seeing strong growth in Asia (which represents more than 55% of sales) and the US (nearly 20%), with slower growth in the EMEA region (another nearly 20%). Western Digital has manufacturing facilities in the US and across Asia and sales offices worldwide.\n\nStrategy\n\nWestern Digital is one of a handful of manufacturers that dominate the hard-disk drive market -- a sector characterized by harsh competition, short product life cycles, and aggressive price cuts. In order to reduce its dependence on drives for PCs, the company has branched into branded consumer media devices, including DVR expanders, portable media drives, and media players that let users play data from external drives on TV. Its WD TV Live Plus media player streams movies (including those offered by Netflix) and Internet video to a digital TV. It is also investing in products for the mobile computing and cloud computing markets.\n\nAnother promising market for Western Digital is nearline hard drives, which are more cost effective than traditional hard drives by providing more capacity while requiring lower power. Nearline hard drives are used for stimulated applications, such as video surveillance and medical imaging, and IT infrastructure applications, including scientific computing and Web search engines.\n\nMergers & Acquisitions\n\nIn 2012 Western Digital bought Hitachi's disk drive business, HGST, for around $4.3 billion in cash and stock. The deal boosts Western Digital's share of the global market to nearly 50%, ahead of rival Seagate Technology which accounts for around 30% of global shipments. Strategically, the deal adds disk drives used with servers -- a large part of both Hitachi and Seagate's businesses -- and gives Western Digital a better foothold in solid-state drives used in tablets and other portable devices. The acquisition also provides Western Digital its first manufacturing foothold in China and the Philippines. With the stock portion of the sale, Hitachi gains a 10% stake in Western Digital and two spots on the board of directors.\n\nWestern Digital has long used acquisitions to add new product lines and extend its geographic reach. Over the past several years it bought the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya for about $233 million and entered the market for solid-state drives with the $65 million purchase of SiliconSystems. In a large 2007 acquisition, Western Digital bought disk component maker Komag for $1 billion, which gave it the ability to manufacture the media and substrates used in its drives.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nWestern Digital's sales have fluctuated in recent years as it has dealt with the worldwide economic downturn. However, its acquisition of HGST helped produce strong results for fiscal 2012 (ended June 30). The company's revenues grew 31% that year to $12.5 billion, with HGST contributing more than $3 billion of that. It also saw an improvement in hard drive average selling price from $45 in fiscal 2011 to $62 in fiscal 2012.\n\nAlthough Western Digital saw increased R&D and SG&A expenses in 2012, the overall strength of revenues led to a 122% jump in net income (to $1.6 billion). \u2013 less",

The bank is primarily active in the UK, where it has some 1,700 branches, but also has significant retail and commercial operations in Europe, Africa (it owns more than half of South African bank Absa Group), the Middle East, and the US. Barclays Bank offers standard retail services such as deposit accounts and lending, including Woolwich-brand mortgages. The bank also provides commercial money transfer services, insurance products, the Barclaycard line of credit cards, and financial advisory services. Barclays Bank traces its roots to the late 17th century.\n\nBarclays Bank has been building up its portfolio of global credit card accounts, especially as other financial groups sell off noncore units during the economic recovery. In 2010 the company acquired the Italian credit card accounts of Citigroup in a deal that included some 197,000 card accounts and approximately \u20ac234 million ($320 million) worth of assets. It previously bought Goldfish, the struggling UK credit card unit of Discover Financial Services, for some \u00a346 million ($70 million). In 2011 Barclays acquired Egg UK's credit card portfolio, which added more than 1 million accounts; it has agreed to buy more Citibank card accounts.\n\nThe bank has also been offloading some of its own holdings as part of an overall corporate restructuring. In 2010 Barclays sold its US subprime loan servicing business, HomEq Servicing, to Ocwen Financial. It also announced plans to abandon retail banking in certain international markets and instead focus on wholesale and commercial banking. In 2011 it shuttered its Indonesian retail unit Bank Akita, which it had acquired only two years before. The company also sold its Russian retail and commercial operations to a group of investors, citing difficulties competing in the market. Barclays will instead focus on its investment banking activities in the region.\n\nIn 2010 Barclays acquired Standard Life Bank from Standard Life for \u00a3226 million ($369 million). The deal added Standard Life's savings and mortgage books to the Barclays fold. Also as part of the deal, Barclays and Standard Life entered into a partnership whereby Barclays markets pension products to its clients.\n\nDespite challenges in the economy, especially in regards to Europe's debt problems, Barclays Bank's revenues grew 8% in 2011. Its Africa business performed relatively strongly, with credit impairments improving, as did Barclaycard, thanks to the portfolio acquisitions which delivered profits. That year the bank closed nearly 150 European branches (largely located in Spain), the costs of which contributed to a 5% decline in net income. \u2013 less",

Founded with five dealerships in 1997, Sonic today owns about 120 new- and used-vehicle dealerships and about 25 collision repair centers in major markets in 15 states, including Texas, the Carolinas, Tennessee and Georgia. The company sells some 30 brands of cars and light trucks and offers vehicle financing. Chairman Smith, who runs Sonic Automotive with his son Scott, is also the majority owner of Speedway Motorsports, which operates more than half a dozen NASCAR auto racetracks.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nOverall, the company's revenues in 2011 accounted for some $7.8 billion versus around $3.6 billion in 2010. Net income came in at $77.6 million in 2011 compared to $95.9 million in 2010, a 15% decrease. In 2011 the impact of earthquakes and the tsunami that struck Japan disrupted the company's Japanese supply chain and vehicle production. Sonic's new vehicle revenues and gross margins were impacted, thus affecting net income. Sonics' new vehicle sales generated around $4.3 million (about 55% of revenues) in revenues in 2011; used vehicle sales accounted for some $2 million (around 25% of revenues), and the company's parts, service and collision segment accounted for around $1.2 million (some 15% of revenues) in revenues.\n\nOperations\n\nIn 2011 the company sold approximately 12.7 million new vehicles compared to 11.6 million vehicles sold in 2010, a year-over-year increase of some 10%. The company sells new vehicles, including luxury (BMW, Lexus, Land Rover, and Volvo), mid-line import (Honda, Nissan, and Toyota), and domestic brands (Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors). Its luxury brands generated some 50% of revenues in 2011; while the company's mid-line and domestic brands accounted for about 35% and 15%, respectively.\n\nStrategy\n\nAs part of the company's strategic plans, Sonic is primarily focused in growing its operations in metropolitan markets in the Southeast, Southwest, Midwest, and the West (California). The company's long-term growth strategy is to target luxury or mid-line import brands.\n\nOwnership\n\nThe Smiths control the company through their ownership of about 75% of Sonic Automotive's voting stock. \u2013 less",

As the primary operating subsidiary of Pacific Mutual Holding Company, Pacific Life offers a wide range of life insurance, asset management, and financial services products, including individual annuities and mutual funds. It also offers a variety of investment products and services for individuals, businesses, and pension plans. Subsidiary Pacific Life & Annuity offers the same mix of life insurance and investment products and services for individuals and businesses in New York. Pacific Life was founded in 1868.\n\nOperations\n\nPacific Life policyholders are members of parent Pacific Mutual Holding Company, which was created in 1997 following a conversion to the mutual holding company structure. Pacific LifeCorp is the intermediate stock holding company.\n\nWhile life insurance is the company's bread and butter, it has brought in other operations for variety. Pacific Life's Aviation Capital Group subsidiary leases commercial jets to 90 airlines in more than 40 countries. It also manages aircraft assets for third parties such as commercial airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and financial institutions. Other subsidiaries include Pacific Asset Management, which provides third-party institutional asset management.\n\nSales & Marketing\n\nPacific Life's insurance policies are sold through independent distributors and through dealer/broker subsidiary Pacific Select Distributors.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nThe company's growth strategies helped Pacific Life achieve strong results in 2011, with revenues increasing 15% over 2010 to almost 6.7 billion, and net income increasing 29% to $679 million. Its operating income climbed a whopping 40% over 2010 to reach $823 million. The gains achieved were attributed to enhanced service offerings, expanded life insurance, annuity, and mutual fund product offerings, and the two acquisitions made that year.\n\nStrategy\n\nBeing a mutual company, Pacific Life operates with a long-term focus to serve in the best interests of its policyholders and clients. in doing so, the company navigated the chilly economic waters of the 2008-2009 recession by steadily introducing new products and building up its capital reserves. By 2010 its net income had grown as risk-weary customers squirreled more of their savings and retirement monies into life insurance and mutual funds.\n\nMergers, Acquisitions & Divestitures\n\nIn 2008 the company added international reinsurance to its portfolio when it acquired the former London-based specialty reinsurance operations of Scottish Re and renamed the business as Pacific Life Re. It then added life retrocession (reinsurance of a reinsurer) to its line-up in 2011 by acquiring that business from Manulife and expanded its business to include the Toronto, Boston, Barbados, and Cologne markets.\n\nAlso in 2011 Pacific life bought JPMorgan Chase's pension risk advisory business to form Pacific Global Advisors. The unit offers risk management solutions and advisory services to pension plan sponsors.\n\nThe firm divested a noncore business, College Savings Bank, in 2012 to a syndicate of investors for an undisclosed price. The banking unit managed two state-sponsored 529 college savings plans. \u2013 less",

            "description": "DCP Midstream Partners is the publicly traded entity of DCP Midstream LLC, one of the largest natural gas gatherers in North America and also the top producer and one of the primary marketers of natural gas liquids (NGLs). It also engages in natural gas compressing, treating, processing, transporting, and selling. DCP Midstream LLC also transports and sells NGLs and distributes propane wholesale. The company operates natural gas gathering systems (5,300 miles of pipe) in eight states (including Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas), seven processing plants, four NGL pipelines, and nine propane storage terminals. Spectra Energy holds a 50% holding in DCP (ConocoPhillips holds the other 50%).\n\nA consolidator in the fragmented natural gas gathering, NGLs, and wholesale propane industry segments, the company has been expanding its gas supply base and its propane wholesale network in recent years through strategic complementary acquisitions and joint ventures.\n\nIn 2012 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Texas-based Crossroads processing plant and gathering system from Penn Virginia Resource Partners for $63 million. The bolt-on acquisition allows the company to expand its market position in East Texas and provide services to drillers in the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley regions.\n\nIn 2011 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Seaway Products Pipeline Co. from ConocoPhillips. The pipeline, now called Southern Hills Pipeline and being converted to NGL service, is expected to be operational by mid-2013. It will provide NGL access from the Midcontinent to the Texas Gulf Coast.\n\nThe company agreed to form a joint venture with EQT Corporation to develop natural gas processing and related natural gas liquid (NGL) infrastructure in the Marcellus and Huron shale plays in the Appalachian basin. (However, the parties could not come to agreement and dropped the plan in early 2011). In 2010, the company acquired the Liberty gathering system and south Raywood processing plant from Ceritas Energy in southeast Texas. The pipeline system interconnects with DCP Midstream's Centana Intrastate Pipeline system.\n\nExpanding in Michigan, in 2009 the company acquired gas gathering and treating assets for $45.1 million. In 2010 it acquired a 350-mile interstate natural gas liquids pipeline system in Colorado's Denver-Julesburg Basin from Buckeye Partners for $22 million.\n\nIn 2010 DCP Midstream Partners moved to extend its Northeast wholesale propane business into the MidAtlantic region, acquiring UGI's Atlantic Energy for $49 million. That year it also purchased of NGL storage company Marysville Hydrocarbon Holdings (in Michigan) for about $95 million.\n\nAlthough DCP Midstream Partners' revenues suffered in 2009 as a result of the global recession and lower commodity prices, acquisitions and organic growth managed to offset lower natural gas volumes.  Acquisitions, increased demand, higher commodity and propane prices, and gains on derivatives help to lift the company's revenues and net income in 2010.\n\nIn terms of the company's origins, the D in DCP Midstream Partners (formerly Duke Energy Field Services) is for Duke Energy; the CP, ConocoPhillips. These two energy majors formed DCP Midstream Partners in 2005. Following the spinoff of Spectra Energy from Duke Energy in 2007, Spectra Energy assumed Duke Energy's 50% holding in DCP. \u2013 less",

            "description": "Independent oil and gas producer Devon Energy puts its energy into oil and gas fields far from England's southwestern coast, in North America. It focuses on exploration and production assets in Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming, and western Canada. In 2011 Devon Energy reported proved reserves of 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent (58% natural gas) and more than 19,900 net acres of assets. It also drilled almost 2,500 gross wells. Devon Energy produces about 2.5 billion cu. ft. of natural gas a day (more than 3% of all the gas consumed in North America). The company is the largest producer and lease holder in the Barnett Shale (Texas) and is looking to replicate its success there to other unconventional plays.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nOnce active in major oil patches worldwide such as Azerbaijan, Brazil, and China, in the mid-2000s the company decided to focus on safer and increasingly productive unconventional onshore exploration opportunities (shales and oil sands) in North America. As a result, Devon Energy has sold all of its international assets.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nDevon Energy posted a major improvement in revenues in 2010, thanks to higher commodity prices and an increase in production. In 2011, buoyed by record level reserves, high oil prices, and an increased demand for oil and gas products, the company posted a further 15% growth in revenues. Net income only rose by 3%, however, as higher operating, depreciation, deletion, and amortization costs and an increase in deferred income tax expense trimmed income growth.\n\nBoosting its financial resources, in 2012 Devon Energy secured a commitment from Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration & Production for the Chinese company to invest $2.2 billion in exchange for one-third of Devon's interest in five new joint venture plays in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, Niobrara, Mississippian, Ohio Utica Shale, and the Michigan Basin.\n\nThat year it also closed a similar $1.4 billion joint venture deal with Sumitomo Corp. to develop 650,000 net acres in the Cline Shale and the Midland-Wolfcamp Shale in West Texas.\n\nStrategy\n\nIn 2010 it sold most of its remaining international assets to BP for $7 billion. As part of this deal BP sold undeveloped oil sand leases in Canada to Devon Energy for $500 million and formed a joint venture with the company to exploit them. The company also sold its Panyu field, offshore China, to China National Offshore Oil for $515 million.\n\nConsolidating its North American assets to just its onshore properties, In 2010 Devon Energy sold its stakes in the Cascade, Jack and St. Malo fields in the Gulf of Mexico (about 200 million barrels of estimated recoverable reserves) to AP Moller-Maersk's oil unit for $1.3 billion. It also sold its remaining Gulf of Mexico shelf assets to Apache for $1 billion. \u2013 less",

            "description": "Independent oil and gas producer Devon Energy puts its energy into oil and gas fields far from England's southwestern coast, in North America. It focuses on exploration and production assets in Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming, and western Canada. In 2011 Devon Energy reported proved reserves of 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent (58% natural gas) and more than 19,900 net acres of assets. It also drilled almost 2,500 gross wells. Devon Energy produces about 2.5 billion cu. ft. of natural gas a day (more than 3% of all the gas consumed in North America). The company is the largest producer and lease holder in the Barnett Shale (Texas) and is looking to replicate its success there to other unconventional plays.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nOnce active in major oil patches worldwide such as Azerbaijan, Brazil, and China, in the mid-2000s the company decided to focus on safer and increasingly productive unconventional onshore exploration opportunities (shales and oil sands) in North America. As a result, Devon Energy has sold all of its international assets.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nDevon Energy posted a major improvement in revenues in 2010, thanks to higher commodity prices and an increase in production. In 2011, buoyed by record level reserves, high oil prices, and an increased demand for oil and gas products, the company posted a further 15% growth in revenues. Net income only rose by 3%, however, as higher operating, depreciation, deletion, and amortization costs and an increase in deferred income tax expense trimmed income growth.\n\nBoosting its financial resources, in 2012 Devon Energy secured a commitment from Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration & Production for the Chinese company to invest $2.2 billion in exchange for one-third of Devon's interest in five new joint venture plays in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, Niobrara, Mississippian, Ohio Utica Shale, and the Michigan Basin.\n\nThat year it also closed a similar $1.4 billion joint venture deal with Sumitomo Corp. to develop 650,000 net acres in the Cline Shale and the Midland-Wolfcamp Shale in West Texas.\n\nStrategy\n\nIn 2010 it sold most of its remaining international assets to BP for $7 billion. As part of this deal BP sold undeveloped oil sand leases in Canada to Devon Energy for $500 million and formed a joint venture with the company to exploit them. The company also sold its Panyu field, offshore China, to China National Offshore Oil for $515 million.\n\nConsolidating its North American assets to just its onshore properties, In 2010 Devon Energy sold its stakes in the Cascade, Jack and St. Malo fields in the Gulf of Mexico (about 200 million barrels of estimated recoverable reserves) to AP Moller-Maersk's oil unit for $1.3 billion. It also sold its remaining Gulf of Mexico shelf assets to Apache for $1 billion. \u2013 less",

It is also the top wind power provider in the US, with wind farms in Colorado, Minnesota, and Texas.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nThe company serves customers in Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin.\n\n \n\nOperations\n\nXcel operates power and gas utilities: Northern States Power, Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service. The holding company has more than 80 generating plants, more than 87,750 miles of transmission lines and about 191,840 miles of distribution lines. It also operates an interstate natural gas pipeline company and a joint venture to develop and lease natural gas pipelines, storage, and compression assets.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nIn 2011 Xcel reported a 3% jump in sales due to an increase in demand caused by a warmer-than-normal summer and a colder-than-normal winter. It was also assisted by a 3.7% increase in the electric segment due to cost recovery of the acquisition of the Rocky Mountain and Blue Spruce natural gas facilities by Public Service Company of Colorado and by natural gas retail rate increases in Minnesota.\n\nNet income rose by 11% thanks to higher revenues and lower electric fuel and purchased power costs.\n\nHigher rates and increased weather-related demand helped sales in 2010 to rise nearly 7%, going from $9.6 billion to about $10.3 billion. \n\nStrategy\n\nXcel is an energy company in transition, with long-term plans to move from coal-fired plants to natural gas, and on to alternative fuels such as wind, solar, and biomass to boost its green  power capacity (88,705 MWh by 2015).\n\nIn 2012 the company was seeking proposals for renewable resources other than wind or solar as part of its plan to diversify Southwestern Public Service Company  renewable energy portfolio.\n\nAs the largest US utility wind energy provider, Xcel controlled some 3,500 MW of wind energy in its portfolio in 2011 and plans to have 7,400 MW by 2020. In 2011 Xcel bought the 200 MW Limon Wind Energy Center, which will have 125 turbines in Lincoln and Elbert counties on Colorado's Front Range east of Denver. The company is also the US's fifth-largest utility solar energy provider and owns the fourth-largest transmission system. In addition, Xcel operates more than 25 hydroelectric power plants in Colorado, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.\n\nThe company believes its strategy of making environmentally sound investments is pivotal to its success. Among its 2010 projects were launching its 800-MW coal-fired unit in Colorado, known as Comanche 3, after installing advanced emission-reduction equipment. It also began construction of its CapX2020 project, a joint venture transmission expansion project with 10 other utilities, scheduled for completion by 2020. The project includes a 240-mile transmission line from Minnesota to North Dakota. The company has filed to extend the licensing plants of its two nuclear plants on Prairie Island in Minnesota for 20 years, which it expects to save customers more than $1 billion compared to alternative sources.\n\nXcel plans to construct one of the largest biomass generating plants in the Midwest. The facility, proposed for the Bay Front Generating Station in Ashland, Wisconsin, will generate power from burning wood waste in all three operating units by 2014. In 2011 Xcel had 73 MW of biomass generating power in Minnesota and Wisconsin.\n\nXcel is also working to develop so-called \"smart grid\" technology, which will provide customers with more reliability and control over their energy use. It has completed the nation's first fully integrated SmartGridCity in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nIn 2010 Xcel acquired two gas-fired power plants from Calpine Corporation for $739 million. The two Denver-area plants have a generating capacity of more than 900 MW and were already providing power to Public Service Company of Colorado under a contract agreement. The company is planning to acquire 775 MW of new wind-power capacity for its Colorado system over the next several years. \u2013 less",

The bank is primarily active in the UK, where it has some 1,700 branches, but also has significant retail and commercial operations in Europe, Africa (it owns more than half of South African bank Absa Group), the Middle East, and the US. Barclays Bank offers standard retail services such as deposit accounts and lending, including Woolwich-brand mortgages. The bank also provides commercial money transfer services, insurance products, the Barclaycard line of credit cards, and financial advisory services. Barclays Bank traces its roots to the late 17th century.\n\nBarclays Bank has been building up its portfolio of global credit card accounts, especially as other financial groups sell off noncore units during the economic recovery. In 2010 the company acquired the Italian credit card accounts of Citigroup in a deal that included some 197,000 card accounts and approximately \u20ac234 million ($320 million) worth of assets. It previously bought Goldfish, the struggling UK credit card unit of Discover Financial Services, for some \u00a346 million ($70 million). In 2011 Barclays acquired Egg UK's credit card portfolio, which added more than 1 million accounts; it has agreed to buy more Citibank card accounts.\n\nThe bank has also been offloading some of its own holdings as part of an overall corporate restructuring. In 2010 Barclays sold its US subprime loan servicing business, HomEq Servicing, to Ocwen Financial. It also announced plans to abandon retail banking in certain international markets and instead focus on wholesale and commercial banking. In 2011 it shuttered its Indonesian retail unit Bank Akita, which it had acquired only two years before. The company also sold its Russian retail and commercial operations to a group of investors, citing difficulties competing in the market. Barclays will instead focus on its investment banking activities in the region.\n\nIn 2010 Barclays acquired Standard Life Bank from Standard Life for \u00a3226 million ($369 million). The deal added Standard Life's savings and mortgage books to the Barclays fold. Also as part of the deal, Barclays and Standard Life entered into a partnership whereby Barclays markets pension products to its clients.\n\nDespite challenges in the economy, especially in regards to Europe's debt problems, Barclays Bank's revenues grew 8% in 2011. Its Africa business performed relatively strongly, with credit impairments improving, as did Barclaycard, thanks to the portfolio acquisitions which delivered profits. That year the bank closed nearly 150 European branches (largely located in Spain), the costs of which contributed to a 5% decline in net income. \u2013 less",

Ameriprise, which has about $630 billion of assets under management, distributes its products primarily through a network of more than 9,700 financial advisors.\n\nThe company has been sharpening its focus on its branded adviser network. It sold its Securities America independent broker-dealer subsidiary to Ladenburg Thalmann for some $150 million in 2011. Shortly before the sale of the troubled unit, Ameriprise agreed to pay $160 million to settle claims that Securities America brokers sold securities in fraudulent companies.\n\nAmeriprise has been steadily boosting its assets under management and growing its client base (focusing on the affluent and mass affluent with at least $100,000 in investable assets). The company also is focused on geographic areas where those clients are congregated and has closed or consolidated offices in areas with less potential.

Ameriprise plans to grow its asset management operations in Europe, as well as in Australia, the Middle East, and Asia.\n\nAmeriprise's strategies have paid off.

However, the company returned to success in 2010 and revenues grew by more than 20% that year. Poor economic conditions continued in 2011. However, Ameriprise's operating net revenues climbed that year by about 10%.

The utility holding company distributes electricity to 3.4 million customers and natural gas to 1.9 million in eight states through four regulated utilities; Colorado and Minnesota account for most of its customers. Its utilities -- Northern States Power (NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin), Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service (in New Mexico and Texas) -- have the combined capacity of more than 17,150 MW of electricity. Xcel owns transmission and distribution lines, as well as natural gas assets. It is also the top wind power provider in the US, with wind farms in Colorado, Minnesota, and Texas.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nThe company serves customers in Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin.\n\n \n\nOperations\n\nXcel operates power and gas utilities: Northern States Power, Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service. The holding company has more than 80 generating plants, more than 87,750 miles of transmission lines and about 191,840 miles of distribution lines. It also operates an interstate natural gas pipeline company and a joint venture to develop and lease natural gas pipelines, storage, and compression assets.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nIn 2011 Xcel reported a 3% jump in sales due to an increase in demand caused by a warmer-than-normal summer and a colder-than-normal winter. It was also assisted by a 3.7% increase in the electric segment due to cost recovery of the acquisition of the Rocky Mountain and Blue Spruce natural gas facilities by Public Service Company of Colorado and by natural gas retail rate increases in Minnesota.\n\nNet income rose by 11% thanks to higher revenues and lower electric fuel and purchased power costs.\n\nHigher rates and increased weather-related demand helped sales in 2010 to rise nearly 7%, going from $9.6 billion to about $10.3 billion. \n\nStrategy\n\nXcel is an energy company in transition, with long-term plans to move from coal-fired plants to natural gas, and on to alternative fuels such as wind, solar, and biomass to boost its green  power capacity (88,705 MWh by 2015).\n\nIn 2012 the company was seeking proposals for renewable resources other than wind or solar as part of its plan to diversify Southwestern Public Service Company  renewable energy portfolio.\n\nAs the largest US utility wind energy provider, Xcel controlled some 3,500 MW of wind energy in its portfolio in 2011 and plans to have 7,400 MW by 2020. In 2011 Xcel bought the 200 MW Limon Wind Energy Center, which will have 125 turbines in Lincoln and Elbert counties on Colorado's Front Range east of Denver. The company is also the US's fifth-largest utility solar energy provider and owns the fourth-largest transmission system. In addition, Xcel operates more than 25 hydroelectric power plants in Colorado, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.\n\nThe company believes its strategy of making environmentally sound investments is pivotal to its success. Among its 2010 projects were launching its 800-MW coal-fired unit in Colorado, known as Comanche 3, after installing advanced emission-reduction equipment. It also began construction of its CapX2020 project, a joint venture transmission expansion project with 10 other utilities, scheduled for completion by 2020. The project includes a 240-mile transmission line from Minnesota to North Dakota. The company has filed to extend the licensing plants of its two nuclear plants on Prairie Island in Minnesota for 20 years, which it expects to save customers more than $1 billion compared to alternative sources.\n\nXcel plans to construct one of the largest biomass generating plants in the Midwest. The facility, proposed for the Bay Front Generating Station in Ashland, Wisconsin, will generate power from burning wood waste in all three operating units by 2014. In 2011 Xcel had 73 MW of biomass generating power in Minnesota and Wisconsin.\n\nXcel is also working to develop so-called \"smart grid\" technology, which will provide customers with more reliability and control over their energy use. It has completed the nation's first fully integrated SmartGridCity in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nIn 2010 Xcel acquired two gas-fired power plants from Calpine Corporation for $739 million. The two Denver-area plants have a generating capacity of more than 900 MW and were already providing power to Public Service Company of Colorado under a contract agreement. The company is planning to acquire 775 MW of new wind-power capacity for its Colorado system over the next several years. \u2013 less",

In 1926, the company introduced the country's first canned ham, and in 1937, it brought us Spam. In 1986, Hormel Foods Corporation acquired Jenny-O Foods, which was the nation's largest privately-owned turkey processor and at the beginning of the millennium it absorbed other major brands such as Diamond Crystal, Century Foods International, Lloyd's Barbeque, and Valley Fresh. In recent years, Hormel Foods Corporation has acquired Skippy peanut butter, Muscle Milk, and Applegate Farms, LLC. Still a major processor of pork and turkey in the U.S., the company's thirty-four brands continue to rank at the top in their respective markets. Hormel Foods Corporation operates joint ventures in seven foreign countries and exports to more the 50 countries around the world.\n\nIn 2015, Hormel Foods Corporation was named by Selling Power as a \"Best Company to Sell For\" and by Simplicity as one of the \"Best Places to Work for Recent Grads.\" The company believes strongly in rewarding its associates with generous compensation packages that will enhance quality of life and provide security for the future. Employees are provided with a non-contributory pension plan, a profit-sharing trust plan, and a 401(k) with employer matching. Health insurance options are provided, as is dental and vision insurance, life insurance, generous paid time off, and various wellness programs.\n\nAssociates of Hormel Foods Corporation overwhelmingly approve of their leadership, particularly the current CEO. Employees commend the company for its \"generous benefits package\" yet the consensus among many is that is a \"lack of commitment to work-life balance\" exists in some locations. Some workers with Hormel Foods Corporation believe that the company's size is a benefit as it \"provides a lot of opportunities for growth and development\" and that the company tends to \"promote from within and invest in their people.\" \u2013 less",

The company was forced to create an interim headquarters in Clinton, Mississippi (a suburb of Jackson).\n\nThe mass evacuation and property damage caused by Hurricane Katrina severely reduced the population served by Entergy New Orleans. Before the big storm it had more than 190,000 electric customers and more than 144,000 gas customers.\n\nThe company reported a 10% drop in net revenue in 2011 due to lower electric rates and weak gas prices. However, net income jumped by $4.9 million thanks to lower operational and maintenance expenses, lower taxes, and lower interest expense.\n\nTo gain better financial returns, Entergy  plans to spin off its transmission businesses (including Entergy New Orleans') and merge them with a subsidiary of ITC Holdings.\n\nIn 2012, as part of a strategy to improve customer relations, Entergy New Orleans introduced a smartphone app to keep customers better informed about company and energy-related matters. \u2013 less",

Through its Foodservice division, PFG supplies more than 68,000 products to independent restaurants, hotels, other hospitality operators, and healthcare facilities through some 20 distribution facilities. The PFG Customized distribution unit serves chain restaurants such as Cracker Barrel and Ruby Tuesday. PFG subsidiary Vistar is a distributor of candy, snacks, and convenience foods for vending operators, retailers, and concessions. The company is owned by The Blackstone Group and Wellspring Capital Management, which took the business private in 2008.\n\nOperations\n\nWith the $1.3 billion buyout in 2008 PFG was merged with Colorado-based Vistar (which was already controlled by Blackstone) to create a giant in the foodservice distribution industry with tentacles reaching into several markets. The combined business continues to operate under the PFG name, although each unit maintains its own headquarters. Across the company's foodservice, Vistar, and customized distribution businesses PFG collectively delivers more than 98,000 national- and proprietary-branded food and food-related products to more than 128,000 customers. As part of its operations, PFG maintains about 70 distribution centers and more than a dozen Merchant's Mart locations in the US.\n\nStrategy\n\nFor PFG's broadline Performance Foodservice division, the focus has been on building the range of products it distributes to existing customers while improving margins. The division's more than 41,000 customers, located in about 40 countries, include franchisees of such chains as Burger King, Popeyes (owned by AFC Enterprises), and Subway. It also serves contract foodservice operators, such as Compass Group North America.\n\nMergers and Acquisitions\n\nThe company moved to expand its broadline division in mid-2012 by acquiring Carolina-based rival Institution Food House from Alex Lee. It also entered into an agreement in late 2012 to buy independent broadline foodservice distributor Fox River Foods, which serves seven states primarily in the Upper Midwestern region. The deals followed PFG's purchase in 2010 of Ledyard Company, which serves central and northern California. To add breadth to its product offering at its New England and Ohio offices, PFG in 2010 bought out the assets of VME Distributors. The wholesale supplier catered to mobile caterers, office coffee services, schools, prisons, and vending operators that do business in New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. \u2013 less",

Through its Foodservice division, PFG supplies more than 68,000 products to independent restaurants, hotels, other hospitality operators, and healthcare facilities through some 20 distribution facilities. The PFG Customized distribution unit serves chain restaurants such as Cracker Barrel and Ruby Tuesday. PFG subsidiary Vistar is a distributor of candy, snacks, and convenience foods for vending operators, retailers, and concessions. The company is owned by The Blackstone Group and Wellspring Capital Management, which took the business private in 2008.\n\nOperations\n\nWith the $1.3 billion buyout in 2008 PFG was merged with Colorado-based Vistar (which was already controlled by Blackstone) to create a giant in the foodservice distribution industry with tentacles reaching into several markets. The combined business continues to operate under the PFG name, although each unit maintains its own headquarters. Across the company's foodservice, Vistar, and customized distribution businesses PFG collectively delivers more than 98,000 national- and proprietary-branded food and food-related products to more than 128,000 customers. As part of its operations, PFG maintains about 70 distribution centers and more than a dozen Merchant's Mart locations in the US.\n\nStrategy\n\nFor PFG's broadline Performance Foodservice division, the focus has been on building the range of products it distributes to existing customers while improving margins. The division's more than 41,000 customers, located in about 40 countries, include franchisees of such chains as Burger King, Popeyes (owned by AFC Enterprises), and Subway. It also serves contract foodservice operators, such as Compass Group North America.\n\nMergers and Acquisitions\n\nThe company moved to expand its broadline division in mid-2012 by acquiring Carolina-based rival Institution Food House from Alex Lee. It also entered into an agreement in late 2012 to buy independent broadline foodservice distributor Fox River Foods, which serves seven states primarily in the Upper Midwestern region. The deals followed PFG's purchase in 2010 of Ledyard Company, which serves central and northern California. To add breadth to its product offering at its New England and Ohio offices, PFG in 2010 bought out the assets of VME Distributors. The wholesale supplier catered to mobile caterers, office coffee services, schools, prisons, and vending operators that do business in New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. \u2013 less",

Bruton Smith has raced Sonic Automotive to the front of the pack of US auto dealers behind larger rivals, such as AutoNation and Penske Automotive. Founded with five dealerships in 1997, Sonic today owns about 120 new- and used-vehicle dealerships and about 25 collision repair centers in major markets in 15 states, including Texas, the Carolinas, Tennessee and Georgia. The company sells some 30 brands of cars and light trucks and offers vehicle financing. Chairman Smith, who runs Sonic Automotive with his son Scott, is also the majority owner of Speedway Motorsports, which operates more than half a dozen NASCAR auto racetracks.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nOverall, the company's revenues in 2011 accounted for some $7.8 billion versus around $3.6 billion in 2010. Net income came in at $77.6 million in 2011 compared to $95.9 million in 2010, a 15% decrease. In 2011 the impact of earthquakes and the tsunami that struck Japan disrupted the company's Japanese supply chain and vehicle production. Sonic's new vehicle revenues and gross margins were impacted, thus affecting net income. Sonics' new vehicle sales generated around $4.3 million (about 55% of revenues) in revenues in 2011; used vehicle sales accounted for some $2 million (around 25% of revenues), and the company's parts, service and collision segment accounted for around $1.2 million (some 15% of revenues) in revenues.\n\nOperations\n\nIn 2011 the company sold approximately 12.7 million new vehicles compared to 11.6 million vehicles sold in 2010, a year-over-year increase of some 10%. The company sells new vehicles, including luxury (BMW, Lexus, Land Rover, and Volvo), mid-line import (Honda, Nissan, and Toyota), and domestic brands (Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors). Its luxury brands generated some 50% of revenues in 2011; while the company's mid-line and domestic brands accounted for about 35% and 15%, respectively.\n\nStrategy\n\nAs part of the company's strategic plans, Sonic is primarily focused in growing its operations in metropolitan markets in the Southeast, Southwest, Midwest, and the West (California). The company's long-term growth strategy is to target luxury or mid-line import brands.\n\nOwnership\n\nThe Smiths control the company through their ownership of about 75% of Sonic Automotive's voting stock. \u2013 less",

            "description": "CenterPoint Energy pivots around its core operations which include power and gas distribution utilities, and natural gas pipeline, gathering, and marketing operations. CenterPoint Energy's regulated utilities distribute natural gas to 3.3 million customers in six US states and electricity to more than 2 million customers on the Texas Gulf Coast. The company's main stomping ground is Texas, where it has regulated power distribution operations through subsidiary CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric. CenterPoint Energy operates more than 48,230 miles of power distribution lines, 8,000 miles of interstate gas pipeline, and 3,800 miles of gas gathering pipeline. It also provides natural gas field services. \n\nOperations\n\nThe company's natural gas distribution subsidiaries serve customers in Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas. (Texas represented 47% of all natural gas distribution customers in 2010). CenterPoint Energy also markets natural gas and related services to 12,200 commercial, industrial, and wholesale customers located primarily in the eastern US. It also provides HVAC and other energy-related services through its gas division.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nCenterPoint Energy's sales dropped dramatically in 2009 as the global recession prompted a slump in commodity prices which hurt the performance of its different energy segments. A reviving economy in 2010 led to a stronger demand for power and gas (coupled with rate increases and weather-related spikes in consumption) resulting in a overall jump in revenues and net income that year.\n\nStrategy\n\nCenterPoint Energy's strategy is focused on enhancing and expanding existing core operations, while acquiring complementary and synergistic businesses. In 2011 the company acquired Denver-based natural gas marketing firm Asgard Energy, which supplies gas to agricultural, commercial, industrial, and residential customers in five states (Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, and West Virginia). The acquisition fit into CenterPoint's strategy to expand into the Rockies and diversify into residential choice markets.\n\nIn 2012, to add to its midstream assets, CenterPoint Energy Field Services (CEFS), an indirect subsidiary of the company, acquired gathering and processing assets from Prism Gas Systems, a subsidiary of Martin Midstream Partners for $275 million. The assets include Prism's 50% stake in Texas-based Waskom Gas Processing Co. A CEFS subsidiary owns the other 50% stake in Waskom.  \u2013 less",

However, we are entering the most dynamic period of change our industry has ever encountered.\n\nAn unprecedented confluence of technology, societal change and public health awareness has created a unique opportunity: the opportunity to make a substantial leap forward in our long-held ambition to provide our consumers with potentially reduced-risk tobacco and nicotine choices.\n\nOur acquisition of Reynolds American Inc. (RAI) in July 2017, which has transformed both the scale and geographic reach of our business and our portfolio of potentially reduced-risk products, now positions us perfectly to capitalise on this ambition.\n\nWe call this ambition Transforming Tobacco and we are fully committed to leading this transformation.\n\n\nThe way our people operate is embodied in our four Guiding Principles: Enterprising Spirit, Freedom Through Responsibility, Open Minded and Strength from Diversity. These principles underpin our culture and guide how we deliver our strategy.\n\nThe culture of the Group is about developing talent from within, stretching and supporting the high performing managers who will lead the delivery of our strategy.

The bank is primarily active in the UK, where it has some 1,700 branches, but also has significant retail and commercial operations in Europe, Africa (it owns more than half of South African bank Absa Group), the Middle East, and the US. Barclays Bank offers standard retail services such as deposit accounts and lending, including Woolwich-brand mortgages. The bank also provides commercial money transfer services, insurance products, the Barclaycard line of credit cards, and financial advisory services. Barclays Bank traces its roots to the late 17th century.\n\nBarclays Bank has been building up its portfolio of global credit card accounts, especially as other financial groups sell off noncore units during the economic recovery. In 2010 the company acquired the Italian credit card accounts of Citigroup in a deal that included some 197,000 card accounts and approximately \u20ac234 million ($320 million) worth of assets. It previously bought Goldfish, the struggling UK credit card unit of Discover Financial Services, for some \u00a346 million ($70 million). In 2011 Barclays acquired Egg UK's credit card portfolio, which added more than 1 million accounts; it has agreed to buy more Citibank card accounts.\n\nThe bank has also been offloading some of its own holdings as part of an overall corporate restructuring. In 2010 Barclays sold its US subprime loan servicing business, HomEq Servicing, to Ocwen Financial. It also announced plans to abandon retail banking in certain international markets and instead focus on wholesale and commercial banking. In 2011 it shuttered its Indonesian retail unit Bank Akita, which it had acquired only two years before. The company also sold its Russian retail and commercial operations to a group of investors, citing difficulties competing in the market. Barclays will instead focus on its investment banking activities in the region.\n\nIn 2010 Barclays acquired Standard Life Bank from Standard Life for \u00a3226 million ($369 million). The deal added Standard Life's savings and mortgage books to the Barclays fold. Also as part of the deal, Barclays and Standard Life entered into a partnership whereby Barclays markets pension products to its clients.\n\nDespite challenges in the economy, especially in regards to Europe's debt problems, Barclays Bank's revenues grew 8% in 2011. Its Africa business performed relatively strongly, with credit impairments improving, as did Barclaycard, thanks to the portfolio acquisitions which delivered profits.

            "description": "Xcel Energy has accelerated its energy engine in utility markets across the US. The utility holding company distributes electricity to 3.4 million customers and natural gas to 1.9 million in eight states through four regulated utilities; Colorado and Minnesota account for most of its customers. Its utilities -- Northern States Power (NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin), Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service (in New Mexico and Texas) -- have the combined capacity of more than 17,150 MW of electricity. Xcel owns transmission and distribution lines, as well as natural gas assets. It is also the top wind power provider in the US, with wind farms in Colorado, Minnesota, and Texas.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nThe company serves customers in Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin.\n\n \n\nOperations\n\nXcel operates power and gas utilities: Northern States Power, Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service. The holding company has more than 80 generating plants, more than 87,750 miles of transmission lines and about 191,840 miles of distribution lines. It also operates an interstate natural gas pipeline company and a joint venture to develop and lease natural gas pipelines, storage, and compression assets.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nIn 2011 Xcel reported a 3% jump in sales due to an increase in demand caused by a warmer-than-normal summer and a colder-than-normal winter. It was also assisted by a 3.7% increase in the electric segment due to cost recovery of the acquisition of the Rocky Mountain and Blue Spruce natural gas facilities by Public Service Company of Colorado and by natural gas retail rate increases in Minnesota.\n\nNet income rose by 11% thanks to higher revenues and lower electric fuel and purchased power costs.\n\nHigher rates and increased weather-related demand helped sales in 2010 to rise nearly 7%, going from $9.6 billion to about $10.3 billion. \n\nStrategy\n\nXcel is an energy company in transition, with long-term plans to move from coal-fired plants to natural gas, and on to alternative fuels such as wind, solar, and biomass to boost its green  power capacity (88,705 MWh by 2015).\n\nIn 2012 the company was seeking proposals for renewable resources other than wind or solar as part of its plan to diversify Southwestern Public Service Company  renewable energy portfolio.\n\nAs the largest US utility wind energy provider, Xcel controlled some 3,500 MW of wind energy in its portfolio in 2011 and plans to have 7,400 MW by 2020. In 2011 Xcel bought the 200 MW Limon Wind Energy Center, which will have 125 turbines in Lincoln and Elbert counties on Colorado's Front Range east of Denver. The company is also the US's fifth-largest utility solar energy provider and owns the fourth-largest transmission system. In addition, Xcel operates more than 25 hydroelectric power plants in Colorado, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.\n\nThe company believes its strategy of making environmentally sound investments is pivotal to its success. Among its 2010 projects were launching its 800-MW coal-fired unit in Colorado, known as Comanche 3, after installing advanced emission-reduction equipment. It also began construction of its CapX2020 project, a joint venture transmission expansion project with 10 other utilities, scheduled for completion by 2020. The project includes a 240-mile transmission line from Minnesota to North Dakota. The company has filed to extend the licensing plants of its two nuclear plants on Prairie Island in Minnesota for 20 years, which it expects to save customers more than $1 billion compared to alternative sources.\n\nXcel plans to construct one of the largest biomass generating plants in the Midwest. The facility, proposed for the Bay Front Generating Station in Ashland, Wisconsin, will generate power from burning wood waste in all three operating units by 2014. In 2011 Xcel had 73 MW of biomass generating power in Minnesota and Wisconsin.\n\nXcel is also working to develop so-called \"smart grid\" technology, which will provide customers with more reliability and control over their energy use. It has completed the nation's first fully integrated SmartGridCity in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nIn 2010 Xcel acquired two gas-fired power plants from Calpine Corporation for $739 million. The two Denver-area plants have a generating capacity of more than 900 MW and were already providing power to Public Service Company of Colorado under a contract agreement. The company is planning to acquire 775 MW of new wind-power capacity for its Colorado system over the next several years. \u2013 less",

            "description": "DCP Midstream Partners is the publicly traded entity of DCP Midstream LLC, one of the largest natural gas gatherers in North America and also the top producer and one of the primary marketers of natural gas liquids (NGLs). It also engages in natural gas compressing, treating, processing, transporting, and selling. DCP Midstream LLC also transports and sells NGLs and distributes propane wholesale. The company operates natural gas gathering systems (5,300 miles of pipe) in eight states (including Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas), seven processing plants, four NGL pipelines, and nine propane storage terminals. Spectra Energy holds a 50% holding in DCP (ConocoPhillips holds the other 50%).\n\nA consolidator in the fragmented natural gas gathering, NGLs, and wholesale propane industry segments, the company has been expanding its gas supply base and its propane wholesale network in recent years through strategic complementary acquisitions and joint ventures.\n\nIn 2012 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Texas-based Crossroads processing plant and gathering system from Penn Virginia Resource Partners for $63 million. The bolt-on acquisition allows the company to expand its market position in East Texas and provide services to drillers in the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley regions.\n\nIn 2011 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Seaway Products Pipeline Co. from ConocoPhillips. The pipeline, now called Southern Hills Pipeline and being converted to NGL service, is expected to be operational by mid-2013. It will provide NGL access from the Midcontinent to the Texas Gulf Coast.\n\nThe company agreed to form a joint venture with EQT Corporation to develop natural gas processing and related natural gas liquid (NGL) infrastructure in the Marcellus and Huron shale plays in the Appalachian basin. (However, the parties could not come to agreement and dropped the plan in early 2011). In 2010, the company acquired the Liberty gathering system and south Raywood processing plant from Ceritas Energy in southeast Texas. The pipeline system interconnects with DCP Midstream's Centana Intrastate Pipeline system.\n\nExpanding in Michigan, in 2009 the company acquired gas gathering and treating assets for $45.1 million. In 2010 it acquired a 350-mile interstate natural gas liquids pipeline system in Colorado's Denver-Julesburg Basin from Buckeye Partners for $22 million.\n\nIn 2010 DCP Midstream Partners moved to extend its Northeast wholesale propane business into the MidAtlantic region, acquiring UGI's Atlantic Energy for $49 million. That year it also purchased of NGL storage company Marysville Hydrocarbon Holdings (in Michigan) for about $95 million.\n\nAlthough DCP Midstream Partners' revenues suffered in 2009 as a result of the global recession and lower commodity prices, acquisitions and organic growth managed to offset lower natural gas volumes.  Acquisitions, increased demand, higher commodity and propane prices, and gains on derivatives help to lift the company's revenues and net income in 2010.\n\nIn terms of the company's origins, the D in DCP Midstream Partners (formerly Duke Energy Field Services) is for Duke Energy; the CP, ConocoPhillips. These two energy majors formed DCP Midstream Partners in 2005. Following the spinoff of Spectra Energy from Duke Energy in 2007, Spectra Energy assumed Duke Energy's 50% holding in DCP. \u2013 less",

            "description": "Independent oil and gas producer Devon Energy puts its energy into oil and gas fields far from England's southwestern coast, in North America. It focuses on exploration and production assets in Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming, and western Canada. In 2011 Devon Energy reported proved reserves of 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent (58% natural gas) and more than 19,900 net acres of assets. It also drilled almost 2,500 gross wells. Devon Energy produces about 2.5 billion cu. ft. of natural gas a day (more than 3% of all the gas consumed in North America). The company is the largest producer and lease holder in the Barnett Shale (Texas) and is looking to replicate its success there to other unconventional plays.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nOnce active in major oil patches worldwide such as Azerbaijan, Brazil, and China, in the mid-2000s the company decided to focus on safer and increasingly productive unconventional onshore exploration opportunities (shales and oil sands) in North America. As a result, Devon Energy has sold all of its international assets.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nDevon Energy posted a major improvement in revenues in 2010, thanks to higher commodity prices and an increase in production. In 2011, buoyed by record level reserves, high oil prices, and an increased demand for oil and gas products, the company posted a further 15% growth in revenues. Net income only rose by 3%, however, as higher operating, depreciation, deletion, and amortization costs and an increase in deferred income tax expense trimmed income growth.\n\nBoosting its financial resources, in 2012 Devon Energy secured a commitment from Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration & Production for the Chinese company to invest $2.2 billion in exchange for one-third of Devon's interest in five new joint venture plays in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, Niobrara, Mississippian, Ohio Utica Shale, and the Michigan Basin.\n\nThat year it also closed a similar $1.4 billion joint venture deal with Sumitomo Corp. to develop 650,000 net acres in the Cline Shale and the Midland-Wolfcamp Shale in West Texas.\n\nStrategy\n\nIn 2010 it sold most of its remaining international assets to BP for $7 billion. As part of this deal BP sold undeveloped oil sand leases in Canada to Devon Energy for $500 million and formed a joint venture with the company to exploit them. The company also sold its Panyu field, offshore China, to China National Offshore Oil for $515 million.\n\nConsolidating its North American assets to just its onshore properties, In 2010 Devon Energy sold its stakes in the Cascade, Jack and St. Malo fields in the Gulf of Mexico (about 200 million barrels of estimated recoverable reserves) to AP Moller-Maersk's oil unit for $1.3 billion. It also sold its remaining Gulf of Mexico shelf assets to Apache for $1 billion. \u2013 less",

Its Ameriprise Bank subsidiary offers deposits and loans. Ameriprise, which has about $630 billion of assets under management, distributes its products primarily through a network of more than 9,700 financial advisors.\n\nThe company has been sharpening its focus on its branded adviser network. It sold its Securities America independent broker-dealer subsidiary to Ladenburg Thalmann for some $150 million in 2011. Shortly before the sale of the troubled unit, Ameriprise agreed to pay $160 million to settle claims that Securities America brokers sold securities in fraudulent companies.\n\nAmeriprise has been steadily boosting its assets under management and growing its client base (focusing on the affluent and mass affluent with at least $100,000 in investable assets). The company also is focused on geographic areas where those clients are congregated and has closed or consolidated offices in areas with less potential. While Columbia Management covers Ameriprise's main asset management market in the US, the company is increasing its global presence through its Threadneedle brand overseas. Ameriprise plans to grow its asset management operations in Europe, as well as in Australia, the Middle East, and Asia.\n\nAmeriprise's strategies have paid off. Volatile financial market conditions, which negatively impacted all of the company's operations, led to a decline in revenue in 2008 and 2009. However, the company returned to success in 2010 and revenues grew by more than 20% that year. Poor economic conditions continued in 2011. However, Ameriprise's operating net revenues climbed that year by about 10%. The boost was due to strong growth in the company's fee-based advisory and asset management businesses.\n\nAmeriprise Financial, which was founded in 1894, was spun off from American Express in 2005. \u2013 less",

The PFG Customized distribution unit serves chain restaurants such as Cracker Barrel and Ruby Tuesday. PFG subsidiary Vistar is a distributor of candy, snacks, and convenience foods for vending operators, retailers, and concessions. The company is owned by The Blackstone Group and Wellspring Capital Management, which took the business private in 2008.\n\nOperations\n\nWith the $1.3 billion buyout in 2008 PFG was merged with Colorado-based Vistar (which was already controlled by Blackstone) to create a giant in the foodservice distribution industry with tentacles reaching into several markets. The combined business continues to operate under the PFG name, although each unit maintains its own headquarters. Across the company's foodservice, Vistar, and customized distribution businesses PFG collectively delivers more than 98,000 national- and proprietary-branded food and food-related products to more than 128,000 customers. As part of its operations, PFG maintains about 70 distribution centers and more than a dozen Merchant's Mart locations in the US.\n\nStrategy\n\nFor PFG's broadline Performance Foodservice division, the focus has been on building the range of products it distributes to existing customers while improving margins. The division's more than 41,000 customers, located in about 40 countries, include franchisees of such chains as Burger King, Popeyes (owned by AFC Enterprises), and Subway. It also serves contract foodservice operators, such as Compass Group North America.\n\nMergers and Acquisitions\n\nThe company moved to expand its broadline division in mid-2012 by acquiring Carolina-based rival Institution Food House from Alex Lee. It also entered into an agreement in late 2012 to buy independent broadline foodservice distributor Fox River Foods, which serves seven states primarily in the Upper Midwestern region. The deals followed PFG's purchase in 2010 of Ledyard Company, which serves central and northern California. To add breadth to its product offering at its New England and Ohio offices, PFG in 2010 bought out the assets of VME Distributors. The wholesale supplier catered to mobile caterers, office coffee services, schools, prisons, and vending operators that do business in New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. \u2013 less",

            "description": "When it comes to data storage, Western Digital has drive. The company is one of the largest independent makers of hard-disk drives, which record, store, and recall volumes of data. Drives for PCs account for most of Western Digital's sales, although the company also makes devices used in servers, cloud computing data centers, and home entertainment products such as set-top boxes and video game consoles. The company sells to manufacturers and through retailers and distributors. More than 60% of its sales are to OEMs such as  Hewlett-Packard, which is Western Digital's largest customer. The company gets more than half of its sales from the Asia/Pacific region.\n\nOperations\n\nWestern Digital is structured around two subsidiaries: WD Technologies and Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST). Each subsidiary maintains its own brand and product lines, with separate sales, marketing, operations, and product development teams. The company is looking to offer improved customer experiences for competing and complementary brands, while finding efficiencies in shared services.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nThe company is seeing strong growth in Asia (which represents more than 55% of sales) and the US (nearly 20%), with slower growth in the EMEA region (another nearly 20%). Western Digital has manufacturing facilities in the US and across Asia and sales offices worldwide.\n\nStrategy\n\nWestern Digital is one of a handful of manufacturers that dominate the hard-disk drive market -- a sector characterized by harsh competition, short product life cycles, and aggressive price cuts. In order to reduce its dependence on drives for PCs, the company has branched into branded consumer media devices, including DVR expanders, portable media drives, and media players that let users play data from external drives on TV. Its WD TV Live Plus media player streams movies (including those offered by Netflix) and Internet video to a digital TV. It is also investing in products for the mobile computing and cloud computing markets.\n\nAnother promising market for Western Digital is nearline hard drives, which are more cost effective than traditional hard drives by providing more capacity while requiring lower power. Nearline hard drives are used for stimulated applications, such as video surveillance and medical imaging, and IT infrastructure applications, including scientific computing and Web search engines.\n\nMergers & Acquisitions\n\nIn 2012 Western Digital bought Hitachi's disk drive business, HGST, for around $4.3 billion in cash and stock. The deal boosts Western Digital's share of the global market to nearly 50%, ahead of rival Seagate Technology which accounts for around 30% of global shipments. Strategically, the deal adds disk drives used with servers -- a large part of both Hitachi and Seagate's businesses -- and gives Western Digital a better foothold in solid-state drives used in tablets and other portable devices. The acquisition also provides Western Digital its first manufacturing foothold in China and the Philippines. With the stock portion of the sale, Hitachi gains a 10% stake in Western Digital and two spots on the board of directors.\n\nWestern Digital has long used acquisitions to add new product lines and extend its geographic reach. Over the past several years it bought the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya for about $233 million and entered the market for solid-state drives with the $65 million purchase of SiliconSystems. In a large 2007 acquisition, Western Digital bought disk component maker Komag for $1 billion, which gave it the ability to manufacture the media and substrates used in its drives.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nWestern Digital's sales have fluctuated in recent years as it has dealt with the worldwide economic downturn. However, its acquisition of HGST helped produce strong results for fiscal 2012 (ended June 30). The company's revenues grew 31% that year to $12.5 billion, with HGST contributing more than $3 billion of that. It also saw an improvement in hard drive average selling price from $45 in fiscal 2011 to $62 in fiscal 2012.\n\nAlthough Western Digital saw increased R&D and SG&A expenses in 2012, the overall strength of revenues led to a 122% jump in net income (to $1.6 billion). \u2013 less",

The company offers financial planning, products, and services to individual and institutional investors. Through Ameriprise Financial, Columbia Management, RiverSource, and other affiliates and brands, the company provides access to insurance, mutual funds, savings plans, personal trust services, retail brokerage, and other financial products and services. Its Ameriprise Bank subsidiary offers deposits and loans. Ameriprise, which has about $630 billion of assets under management, distributes its products primarily through a network of more than 9,700 financial advisors.\n\nThe company has been sharpening its focus on its branded adviser network. It sold its Securities America independent broker-dealer subsidiary to Ladenburg Thalmann for some $150 million in 2011. Shortly before the sale of the troubled unit, Ameriprise agreed to pay $160 million to settle claims that Securities America brokers sold securities in fraudulent companies.\n\nAmeriprise has been steadily boosting its assets under management and growing its client base (focusing on the affluent and mass affluent with at least $100,000 in investable assets). The company also is focused on geographic areas where those clients are congregated and has closed or consolidated offices in areas with less potential. While Columbia Management covers Ameriprise's main asset management market in the US, the company is increasing its global presence through its Threadneedle brand overseas. Ameriprise plans to grow its asset management operations in Europe, as well as in Australia, the Middle East, and Asia.\n\nAmeriprise's strategies have paid off. Volatile financial market conditions, which negatively impacted all of the company's operations, led to a decline in revenue in 2008 and 2009. However, the company returned to success in 2010 and revenues grew by more than 20% that year. Poor economic conditions continued in 2011. However, Ameriprise's operating net revenues climbed that year by about 10%. The boost was due to strong growth in the company's fee-based advisory and asset management businesses.\n\nAmeriprise Financial, which was founded in 1894, was spun off from American Express in 2005. \u2013 less",

The bank is primarily active in the UK, where it has some 1,700 branches, but also has significant retail and commercial operations in Europe, Africa (it owns more than half of South African bank Absa Group), the Middle East, and the US. Barclays Bank offers standard retail services such as deposit accounts and lending, including Woolwich-brand mortgages. The bank also provides commercial money transfer services, insurance products, the Barclaycard line of credit cards, and financial advisory services. Barclays Bank traces its roots to the late 17th century.\n\nBarclays Bank has been building up its portfolio of global credit card accounts, especially as other financial groups sell off noncore units during the economic recovery. In 2010 the company acquired the Italian credit card accounts of Citigroup in a deal that included some 197,000 card accounts and approximately \u20ac234 million ($320 million) worth of assets. It previously bought Goldfish, the struggling UK credit card unit of Discover Financial Services, for some \u00a346 million ($70 million). In 2011 Barclays acquired Egg UK's credit card portfolio, which added more than 1 million accounts; it has agreed to buy more Citibank card accounts.\n\nThe bank has also been offloading some of its own holdings as part of an overall corporate restructuring. In 2010 Barclays sold its US subprime loan servicing business, HomEq Servicing, to Ocwen Financial. It also announced plans to abandon retail banking in certain international markets and instead focus on wholesale and commercial banking. In 2011 it shuttered its Indonesian retail unit Bank Akita, which it had acquired only two years before. The company also sold its Russian retail and commercial operations to a group of investors, citing difficulties competing in the market. Barclays will instead focus on its investment banking activities in the region.\n\nIn 2010 Barclays acquired Standard Life Bank from Standard Life for \u00a3226 million ($369 million). The deal added Standard Life's savings and mortgage books to the Barclays fold. Also as part of the deal, Barclays and Standard Life entered into a partnership whereby Barclays markets pension products to its clients.\n\nDespite challenges in the economy, especially in regards to Europe's debt problems, Barclays Bank's revenues grew 8% in 2011. Its Africa business performed relatively strongly, with credit impairments improving, as did Barclaycard, thanks to the portfolio acquisitions which delivered profits. That year the bank closed nearly 150 European branches (largely located in Spain), the costs of which contributed to a 5% decline in net income. \u2013 less",

In addition to auto coverage, the company provides a range of personal property/casualty and life insurance products to more than 3 million policyholders. Auto-Owners Insurance Group operates through subsidiaries including Auto-Owners Life Insurance, Home-Owners Insurance, and Property-Owners Insurance Company. Its Southern-Owners Insurance subsidiary offers property/casualty insurance in Florida. Auto-Owners Insurance also sells commercial auto, liability, and workers' compensation policies. Established in 1916, the company operates in 26 states nationwide and is represented by more than 6,000 independent agencies.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nAuto-Owners operates 85 claims, underwriting, and marketing offices in its 26-state service territory. The company's largest markets are Florida and Michigan.\n\nOperations\n\nAuto-Owners' revenues come from insurance premiums, as well as investment income. The company's property/casualty business accounts for about 90% of revenues and 80% of profits, with the remainder coming from premiums and income from the life insurance segment.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nAuto-Owners reported a 5% increase in net written premiums in 2011 to nearly $5.2 billion, primarily due to growth within the Auto-Owners Insurance, Auto-Owners Life, and Home-Owners Insurance divisions. Total revenues were some $5.7 billion, while net income was reported at $69 million.\n\nStrategy\n\nAuto-Owners is focused on growing its business by establishing strong relationships with independent agents and by diversifying its product offerings. The company has also expanded by adding sales and service facilities in new and existing markets. In 2011 Auto-Owners opened five new branch locations to handle claims in Ashville, North Carolina; Kennesaw, Georgia; Little Rock, Arkansas; Madison, Wisconsin; and Sioux Falls, South Dakota. The Little Rock location also provides underwriting. New construction that year included a backup data center in Traverse City, Michigan, and offices in Broomfield, Colorado, and Columbia, Missouri, to replace existing branches. \u2013 less",

            "description": "Ameren provides the power that makes much of the American Midwest run. The holding company distributes electricity to 2.4 million customers and natural gas to 900,000 customers in Missouri and Illinois through utility subsidiaries. Ameren has a generating capacity of 16,000 MW (primarily coal-fired), most of which is controlled by utility Union Electric (which does business as Ameren Missouri) and nonregulated subsidiary AmerenEnergy Resources Generating Company. Ameren, which also supplies merchant generation power to third parties, operates a nuclear power facility, three hydroelectric plants, and several coal-fired plants and turbine combustion facilities. It also purchases power, including windpower.\n\nOperations\n\nIn addition to operating power plants, Ameren procures natural gas for its affiliated companies, builds new power plants, and provides long-term energy supply contracts. It also markets and trades electricity to wholesale and retail customers and provides risk management and other energy-related services.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nAmeren's overall revenues dipped in 2011. While increased rates helped to lift Ameren Missouri's revenues in 2011, Ameren Illinois' regulated segment and the merchant generation segment both reported a drop in revenues. In particular, low gas prices and a warm winter hurt gas revenues. However, lower purchased power and resale gas, coupled with a drop in goodwill, impairment, and other charges, helped to lift Ameren's net income for the year.\n\nFavorable weather conditions (which increased energy demand) and rate increases help to lift the company's revenues in 2010. However, impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets in the merchant generation segment (due to the sustained decline in market prices for electricity) dragged down Ameren's operating income.\n\nStrategy\n\nIn 2010 the company combined AmerenIP, AmerenCIPS, and AmerenCILCO into one entity, Ameren Illinois, in order to streamline operations and reduce confusion among customers. The three Illinois utilities have operated as a single business since 2004 and deliver energy to more than 1,100 communities. Ameren Illinois also operates some 21,400 miles of natural gas distribution and transmission lines.\n\nTo comply with federal requirements to separate ownership of power generation and transmission businesses, the operations of Ameren subsidiaries' transmission assets are under the control ofMidwest Independent Transmission System Operator, a regional transmission organization that coordinates power across 15 Midwestern states and one Canadian Province.  \u2013 less",

            "description": "When it comes to data storage, Western Digital has drive. The company is one of the largest independent makers of hard-disk drives, which record, store, and recall volumes of data. Drives for PCs account for most of Western Digital's sales, although the company also makes devices used in servers, cloud computing data centers, and home entertainment products such as set-top boxes and video game consoles. The company sells to manufacturers and through retailers and distributors. More than 60% of its sales are to OEMs such as  Hewlett-Packard, which is Western Digital's largest customer. The company gets more than half of its sales from the Asia/Pacific region.\n\nOperations\n\nWestern Digital is structured around two subsidiaries: WD Technologies and Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST). Each subsidiary maintains its own brand and product lines, with separate sales, marketing, operations, and product development teams. The company is looking to offer improved customer experiences for competing and complementary brands, while finding efficiencies in shared services.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nThe company is seeing strong growth in Asia (which represents more than 55% of sales) and the US (nearly 20%), with slower growth in the EMEA region (another nearly 20%). Western Digital has manufacturing facilities in the US and across Asia and sales offices worldwide.\n\nStrategy\n\nWestern Digital is one of a handful of manufacturers that dominate the hard-disk drive market -- a sector characterized by harsh competition, short product life cycles, and aggressive price cuts. In order to reduce its dependence on drives for PCs, the company has branched into branded consumer media devices, including DVR expanders, portable media drives, and media players that let users play data from external drives on TV. Its WD TV Live Plus media player streams movies (including those offered by Netflix) and Internet video to a digital TV. It is also investing in products for the mobile computing and cloud computing markets.\n\nAnother promising market for Western Digital is nearline hard drives, which are more cost effective than traditional hard drives by providing more capacity while requiring lower power. Nearline hard drives are used for stimulated applications, such as video surveillance and medical imaging, and IT infrastructure applications, including scientific computing and Web search engines.\n\nMergers & Acquisitions\n\nIn 2012 Western Digital bought Hitachi's disk drive business, HGST, for around $4.3 billion in cash and stock. The deal boosts Western Digital's share of the global market to nearly 50%, ahead of rival Seagate Technology which accounts for around 30% of global shipments. Strategically, the deal adds disk drives used with servers -- a large part of both Hitachi and Seagate's businesses -- and gives Western Digital a better foothold in solid-state drives used in tablets and other portable devices. The acquisition also provides Western Digital its first manufacturing foothold in China and the Philippines. With the stock portion of the sale, Hitachi gains a 10% stake in Western Digital and two spots on the board of directors.\n\nWestern Digital has long used acquisitions to add new product lines and extend its geographic reach. Over the past several years it bought the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya for about $233 million and entered the market for solid-state drives with the $65 million purchase of SiliconSystems. In a large 2007 acquisition, Western Digital bought disk component maker Komag for $1 billion, which gave it the ability to manufacture the media and substrates used in its drives.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nWestern Digital's sales have fluctuated in recent years as it has dealt with the worldwide economic downturn. However, its acquisition of HGST helped produce strong results for fiscal 2012 (ended June 30). The company's revenues grew 31% that year to $12.5 billion, with HGST contributing more than $3 billion of that. It also saw an improvement in hard drive average selling price from $45 in fiscal 2011 to $62 in fiscal 2012.\n\nAlthough Western Digital saw increased R&D and SG&A expenses in 2012, the overall strength of revenues led to a 122% jump in net income (to $1.6 billion). \u2013 less",

            "description": "Xcel Energy has accelerated its energy engine in utility markets across the US. The utility holding company distributes electricity to 3.4 million customers and natural gas to 1.9 million in eight states through four regulated utilities; Colorado and Minnesota account for most of its customers. Its utilities -- Northern States Power (NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin), Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service (in New Mexico and Texas) -- have the combined capacity of more than 17,150 MW of electricity. Xcel owns transmission and distribution lines, as well as natural gas assets. It is also the top wind power provider in the US, with wind farms in Colorado, Minnesota, and Texas.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nThe company serves customers in Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin.\n\n \n\nOperations\n\nXcel operates power and gas utilities: Northern States Power, Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service. The holding company has more than 80 generating plants, more than 87,750 miles of transmission lines and about 191,840 miles of distribution lines. It also operates an interstate natural gas pipeline company and a joint venture to develop and lease natural gas pipelines, storage, and compression assets.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nIn 2011 Xcel reported a 3% jump in sales due to an increase in demand caused by a warmer-than-normal summer and a colder-than-normal winter. It was also assisted by a 3.7% increase in the electric segment due to cost recovery of the acquisition of the Rocky Mountain and Blue Spruce natural gas facilities by Public Service Company of Colorado and by natural gas retail rate increases in Minnesota.\n\nNet income rose by 11% thanks to higher revenues and lower electric fuel and purchased power costs.\n\nHigher rates and increased weather-related demand helped sales in 2010 to rise nearly 7%, going from $9.6 billion to about $10.3 billion. \n\nStrategy\n\nXcel is an energy company in transition, with long-term plans to move from coal-fired plants to natural gas, and on to alternative fuels such as wind, solar, and biomass to boost its green  power capacity (88,705 MWh by 2015).\n\nIn 2012 the company was seeking proposals for renewable resources other than wind or solar as part of its plan to diversify Southwestern Public Service Company  renewable energy portfolio.\n\nAs the largest US utility wind energy provider, Xcel controlled some 3,500 MW of wind energy in its portfolio in 2011 and plans to have 7,400 MW by 2020. In 2011 Xcel bought the 200 MW Limon Wind Energy Center, which will have 125 turbines in Lincoln and Elbert counties on Colorado's Front Range east of Denver. The company is also the US's fifth-largest utility solar energy provider and owns the fourth-largest transmission system. In addition, Xcel operates more than 25 hydroelectric power plants in Colorado, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.\n\nThe company believes its strategy of making environmentally sound investments is pivotal to its success. Among its 2010 projects were launching its 800-MW coal-fired unit in Colorado, known as Comanche 3, after installing advanced emission-reduction equipment. It also began construction of its CapX2020 project, a joint venture transmission expansion project with 10 other utilities, scheduled for completion by 2020. The project includes a 240-mile transmission line from Minnesota to North Dakota. The company has filed to extend the licensing plants of its two nuclear plants on Prairie Island in Minnesota for 20 years, which it expects to save customers more than $1 billion compared to alternative sources.\n\nXcel plans to construct one of the largest biomass generating plants in the Midwest. The facility, proposed for the Bay Front Generating Station in Ashland, Wisconsin, will generate power from burning wood waste in all three operating units by 2014. In 2011 Xcel had 73 MW of biomass generating power in Minnesota and Wisconsin.\n\nXcel is also working to develop so-called \"smart grid\" technology, which will provide customers with more reliability and control over their energy use. It has completed the nation's first fully integrated SmartGridCity in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nIn 2010 Xcel acquired two gas-fired power plants from Calpine Corporation for $739 million. The two Denver-area plants have a generating capacity of more than 900 MW and were already providing power to Public Service Company of Colorado under a contract agreement. The company is planning to acquire 775 MW of new wind-power capacity for its Colorado system over the next several years. \u2013 less",

The bolt-on acquisition allows the company to expand its market position in East Texas and provide services to drillers in the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley regions.\n\nIn 2011 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Seaway Products Pipeline Co. from ConocoPhillips. The pipeline, now called Southern Hills Pipeline and being converted to NGL service, is expected to be operational by mid-2013. It will provide NGL access from the Midcontinent to the Texas Gulf Coast.\n\nThe company agreed to form a joint venture with EQT Corporation to develop natural gas processing and related natural gas liquid (NGL) infrastructure in the Marcellus and Huron shale plays in the Appalachian basin. (However, the parties could not come to agreement and dropped the plan in early 2011). In 2010, the company acquired the Liberty gathering system and south Raywood processing plant from Ceritas Energy in southeast Texas. The pipeline system interconnects with DCP Midstream's Centana Intrastate Pipeline system.\n\nExpanding in Michigan, in 2009 the company acquired gas gathering and treating assets for $45.1 million. In 2010 it acquired a 350-mile interstate natural gas liquids pipeline system in Colorado's Denver-Julesburg Basin from Buckeye Partners for $22 million.\n\nIn 2010 DCP Midstream Partners moved to extend its Northeast wholesale propane business into the MidAtlantic region, acquiring UGI's Atlantic Energy for $49 million. That year it also purchased of NGL storage company Marysville Hydrocarbon Holdings (in Michigan) for about $95 million.\n\nAlthough DCP Midstream Partners' revenues suffered in 2009 as a result of the global recession and lower commodity prices, acquisitions and organic growth managed to offset lower natural gas volumes.  Acquisitions, increased demand, higher commodity and propane prices, and gains on derivatives help to lift the company's revenues and net income in 2010.\n\nIn terms of the company's origins, the D in DCP Midstream Partners (formerly Duke Energy Field Services) is for Duke Energy; the CP, ConocoPhillips. These two energy majors formed DCP Midstream Partners in 2005. Following the spinoff of Spectra Energy from Duke Energy in 2007, Spectra Energy assumed Duke Energy's 50% holding in DCP. \u2013 less",

The utility has a net generating capacity of about 19,200 MW from interests in fossil-fueled, nuclear, and hydroelectric power plants. Duke Energy Carolinas also sells power to wholesale customers.\n\nThe utility's three nuclear plants account for more than a quarter of Duke Energy Carolinas' generating capacity.\n\nDuke Energy Carolinas is investing $7 billion from 2010 to 2012 to expand its generating capacity and maintain its nuclear fuel and plants. By 2020 the company is looking to expand capacity by 5,400 MW, a strategy that brings new plants online while replacing older, less efficient ones.\n\nThe global recession produced weaker demand for power (especially from industrial customers) which lowered company revenues in 2009. However, the same downturn cut fuel expenses (including purchased power from third parties) resulting in only a slight dip in Duke Energy Carolinas' operating income.\n\nIn 2010 the company saw its revenues rise, primarily due to new retail electric base rates in North Carolina and South Carolina, and favorable weather conditions which spurred demand. Duke Energy Carolinas also posted higher net income, despite an increase in fuel costs and expenses related to an employee voluntary severance plan. \u2013 less",

            "description": "Independent oil and gas producer Devon Energy puts its energy into oil and gas fields far from England's southwestern coast, in North America. It focuses on exploration and production assets in Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming, and western Canada. In 2011 Devon Energy reported proved reserves of 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent (58% natural gas) and more than 19,900 net acres of assets. It also drilled almost 2,500 gross wells. Devon Energy produces about 2.5 billion cu. ft. of natural gas a day (more than 3% of all the gas consumed in North America). The company is the largest producer and lease holder in the Barnett Shale (Texas) and is looking to replicate its success there to other unconventional plays.\n\nGeographic Reach\n\nOnce active in major oil patches worldwide such as Azerbaijan, Brazil, and China, in the mid-2000s the company decided to focus on safer and increasingly productive unconventional onshore exploration opportunities (shales and oil sands) in North America. As a result, Devon Energy has sold all of its international assets.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nDevon Energy posted a major improvement in revenues in 2010, thanks to higher commodity prices and an increase in production. In 2011, buoyed by record level reserves, high oil prices, and an increased demand for oil and gas products, the company posted a further 15% growth in revenues. Net income only rose by 3%, however, as higher operating, depreciation, deletion, and amortization costs and an increase in deferred income tax expense trimmed income growth.\n\nBoosting its financial resources, in 2012 Devon Energy secured a commitment from Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration & Production for the Chinese company to invest $2.2 billion in exchange for one-third of Devon's interest in five new joint venture plays in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, Niobrara, Mississippian, Ohio Utica Shale, and the Michigan Basin.\n\nThat year it also closed a similar $1.4 billion joint venture deal with Sumitomo Corp. to develop 650,000 net acres in the Cline Shale and the Midland-Wolfcamp Shale in West Texas.\n\nStrategy\n\nIn 2010 it sold most of its remaining international assets to BP for $7 billion. As part of this deal BP sold undeveloped oil sand leases in Canada to Devon Energy for $500 million and formed a joint venture with the company to exploit them. The company also sold its Panyu field, offshore China, to China National Offshore Oil for $515 million.\n\nConsolidating its North American assets to just its onshore properties, In 2010 Devon Energy sold its stakes in the Cascade, Jack and St. Malo fields in the Gulf of Mexico (about 200 million barrels of estimated recoverable reserves) to AP Moller-Maersk's oil unit for $1.3 billion. It also sold its remaining Gulf of Mexico shelf assets to Apache for $1 billion. \u2013 less",

In 2015 alone, with the help of our generous customers, Albertsons Companies and the Albertsons Companies Foundation gave more than $270 million in food and financial support to the more than 2,300 communities we serve, improving the lives of millions of people in the areas of hunger relief, education, cancer research and treatment, programs for people with disabilities, and veterans outreach.\n\nAll of our stores were founded around the philosophy of offering customers the products they wanted to buy at a fair price, with lots of tender, loving care.

Bruton Smith has raced Sonic Automotive to the front of the pack of US auto dealers behind larger rivals, such as AutoNation and Penske Automotive. Founded with five dealerships in 1997, Sonic today owns about 120 new- and used-vehicle dealerships and about 25 collision repair centers in major markets in 15 states, including Texas, the Carolinas, Tennessee and Georgia. The company sells some 30 brands of cars and light trucks and offers vehicle financing. Chairman Smith, who runs Sonic Automotive with his son Scott, is also the majority owner of Speedway Motorsports, which operates more than half a dozen NASCAR auto racetracks.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nOverall, the company's revenues in 2011 accounted for some $7.8 billion versus around $3.6 billion in 2010. Net income came in at $77.6 million in 2011 compared to $95.9 million in 2010, a 15% decrease. In 2011 the impact of earthquakes and the tsunami that struck Japan disrupted the company's Japanese supply chain and vehicle production. Sonic's new vehicle revenues and gross margins were impacted, thus affecting net income. Sonics' new vehicle sales generated around $4.3 million (about 55% of revenues) in revenues in 2011; used vehicle sales accounted for some $2 million (around 25% of revenues), and the company's parts, service and collision segment accounted for around $1.2 million (some 15% of revenues) in revenues.\n\nOperations\n\nIn 2011 the company sold approximately 12.7 million new vehicles compared to 11.6 million vehicles sold in 2010, a year-over-year increase of some 10%. The company sells new vehicles, including luxury (BMW, Lexus, Land Rover, and Volvo), mid-line import (Honda, Nissan, and Toyota), and domestic brands (Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors). Its luxury brands generated some 50% of revenues in 2011; while the company's mid-line and domestic brands accounted for about 35% and 15%, respectively.\n\nStrategy\n\nAs part of the company's strategic plans, Sonic is primarily focused in growing its operations in metropolitan markets in the Southeast, Southwest, Midwest, and the West (California). The company's long-term growth strategy is to target luxury or mid-line import brands.\n\nOwnership\n\nThe Smiths control the company through their ownership of about 75% of Sonic Automotive's voting stock. \u2013 less",

            "description": "Dover Corp. operates in four primary sectors: Fluids, Engineered Systems, Refrigeration and Food Equipment and Energy. It was founded in 1955 as a conglomerate of four manufacturing companies that had been purchased in the 1930s and 1940s by stockbroker George Ohrstrom Sr. The companies made piston rings and seals, auto lifts, oil-well rods and space heaters. From its founding until 1979, Dover bought 14 companies, largely to build the company's elevator business. It was one of the leading elevator companies in the United States until selling that business in 1998. In more recent years, Dover Corp. has experienced rapid growth, purchasing nearly 100 companies in a 15-year span.\n\nDover Corp. offers its employees comprehensive healthcare coverage as well as a generous 401(k) contribution match. The company recently launched a comprehensive wellness campaign at each of its sites, which highlights its commitment to employee health. Employees are pleased with Dover's \"strong culture and operating discipline\" and its employees who \"want to make a positive difference\" in the company. Some indicate that there is a \"tremendous work ethic\" at Dover Corp., though others mention the learning platform for new employees \"needs work.\" \u2013 less",

            "description": "Barclays Bank is the flagship subsidiary of global financial group Barclays PLC. The bank is primarily active in the UK, where it has some 1,700 branches, but also has significant retail and commercial operations in Europe, Africa (it owns more than half of South African bank Absa Group), the Middle East, and the US. Barclays Bank offers standard retail services such as deposit accounts and lending, including Woolwich-brand mortgages. The bank also provides commercial money transfer services, insurance products, the Barclaycard line of credit cards, and financial advisory services. Barclays Bank traces its roots to the late 17th century.\n\nBarclays Bank has been building up its portfolio of global credit card accounts, especially as other financial groups sell off noncore units during the economic recovery. In 2010 the company acquired the Italian credit card accounts of Citigroup in a deal that included some 197,000 card accounts and approximately \u20ac234 million ($320 million) worth of assets. It previously bought Goldfish, the struggling UK credit card unit of Discover Financial Services, for some \u00a346 million ($70 million). In 2011 Barclays acquired Egg UK's credit card portfolio, which added more than 1 million accounts; it has agreed to buy more Citibank card accounts.\n\nThe bank has also been offloading some of its own holdings as part of an overall corporate restructuring. In 2010 Barclays sold its US subprime loan servicing business, HomEq Servicing, to Ocwen Financial. It also announced plans to abandon retail banking in certain international markets and instead focus on wholesale and commercial banking. In 2011 it shuttered its Indonesian retail unit Bank Akita, which it had acquired only two years before. The company also sold its Russian retail and commercial operations to a group of investors, citing difficulties competing in the market. Barclays will instead focus on its investment banking activities in the region.\n\nIn 2010 Barclays acquired Standard Life Bank from Standard Life for \u00a3226 million ($369 million). The deal added Standard Life's savings and mortgage books to the Barclays fold. Also as part of the deal, Barclays and Standard Life entered into a partnership whereby Barclays markets pension products to its clients.\n\nDespite challenges in the economy, especially in regards to Europe's debt problems, Barclays Bank's revenues grew 8% in 2011. Its Africa business performed relatively strongly, with credit impairments improving, as did Barclaycard, thanks to the portfolio acquisitions which delivered profits. That year the bank closed nearly 150 European branches (largely located in Spain), the costs of which contributed to a 5% decline in net income. \u2013 less",
