The PFG Customized distribution unit serves chain restaurants such as Cracker Barrel and Ruby Tuesday. PFG subsidiary Vistar is a distributor of candy, snacks, and convenience foods for vending operators, retailers, and concessions. The company is owned by The Blackstone Group and Wellspring Capital Management, which took the business private in 2008.\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nWith the $1.3 billion buyout in 2008 PFG was merged with Colorado-based Vistar (which was already controlled by Blackstone) to create a giant in the foodservice distribution industry with tentacles reaching into several markets. The combined business continues to operate under the PFG name, although each unit maintains its own headquarters. Across the company's foodservice, Vistar, and customized distribution businesses PFG collectively delivers more than 98,000 national- and proprietary-branded food and food-related products to more than 128,000 customers. As part of its operations, PFG maintains about 70 distribution centers and more than a dozen Merchant's Mart locations in the US.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nFor PFG's broadline Performance Foodservice division, the focus has been on building the range of products it distributes to existing customers while improving margins. The division's more than 41,000 customers, located in about 40 countries, include franchisees of such chains as Burger King, Popeyes (owned by AFC Enterprises), and Subway. It also serves contract foodservice operators, such as Compass Group North America.\\n\\nMergers and Acquisitions\\n\\nThe company moved to expand its broadline division in mid-2012 by acquiring Carolina-based rival Institution Food House from Alex Lee.

       "   'description': \"Ameren provides the power that makes much of the American Midwest run. The holding company distributes electricity to 2.4 million customers and natural gas to 900,000 customers in Missouri and Illinois through utility subsidiaries. Ameren has a generating capacity of 16,000 MW (primarily coal-fired), most of which is controlled by utility Union Electric (which does business as Ameren Missouri) and nonregulated subsidiary AmerenEnergy Resources Generating Company. Ameren, which also supplies merchant generation power to third parties, operates a nuclear power facility, three hydroelectric plants, and several coal-fired plants and turbine combustion facilities. It also purchases power, including windpower.\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nIn addition to operating power plants, Ameren procures natural gas for its affiliated companies, builds new power plants, and provides long-term energy supply contracts. It also markets and trades electricity to wholesale and retail customers and provides risk management and other energy-related services.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis\\n\\nAmeren's overall revenues dipped in 2011. While increased rates helped to lift Ameren Missouri's revenues in 2011, Ameren Illinois' regulated segment and the merchant generation segment both reported a drop in revenues. In particular, low gas prices and a warm winter hurt gas revenues. However, lower purchased power and resale gas, coupled with a drop in goodwill, impairment, and other charges, helped to lift Ameren's net income for the year.\\n\\nFavorable weather conditions (which increased energy demand) and rate increases help to lift the company's revenues in 2010. However, impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets in the merchant generation segment (due to the sustained decline in market prices for electricity) dragged down Ameren's operating income.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nIn 2010 the company combined AmerenIP, AmerenCIPS, and AmerenCILCO into one entity, Ameren Illinois, in order to streamline operations and reduce confusion among customers. The three Illinois utilities have operated as a single business since 2004 and deliver energy to more than 1,100 communities. Ameren Illinois also operates some 21,400 miles of natural gas distribution and transmission lines.\\n\\nTo comply with federal requirements to separate ownership of power generation and transmission businesses, the operations of Ameren subsidiaries' transmission assets are under the control ofMidwest Independent Transmission System Operator, a regional transmission organization that coordinates power across 15 Midwestern states and one Canadian Province.  – less\",\n",

The bank is primarily active in the UK, where it has some 1,700 branches, but also has significant retail and commercial operations in Europe, Africa (it owns more than half of South African bank Absa Group), the Middle East, and the US. Barclays Bank offers standard retail services such as deposit accounts and lending, including Woolwich-brand mortgages. The bank also provides commercial money transfer services, insurance products, the Barclaycard line of credit cards, and financial advisory services. Barclays Bank traces its roots to the late 17th century.\\n\\nBarclays Bank has been building up its portfolio of global credit card accounts, especially as other financial groups sell off noncore units during the economic recovery. In 2010 the company acquired the Italian credit card accounts of Citigroup in a deal that included some 197,000 card accounts and approximately €234 million ($320 million) worth of assets. It previously bought Goldfish, the struggling UK credit card unit of Discover Financial Services, for some £46 million ($70 million). In 2011 Barclays acquired Egg UK's credit card portfolio, which added more than 1 million accounts; it has agreed to buy more Citibank card accounts.\\n\\nThe bank has also been offloading some of its own holdings as part of an overall corporate restructuring. In 2010 Barclays sold its US subprime loan servicing business, HomEq Servicing, to Ocwen Financial. It also announced plans to abandon retail banking in certain international markets and instead focus on wholesale and commercial banking. In 2011 it shuttered its Indonesian retail unit Bank Akita, which it had acquired only two years before. The company also sold its Russian retail and commercial operations to a group of investors, citing difficulties competing in the market. Barclays will instead focus on its investment banking activities in the region.\\n\\nIn 2010 Barclays acquired Standard Life Bank from Standard Life for £226 million ($369 million). The deal added Standard Life's savings and mortgage books to the Barclays fold. Also as part of the deal, Barclays and Standard Life entered into a partnership whereby Barclays markets pension products to its clients.\\n\\nDespite challenges in the economy, especially in regards to Europe's debt problems, Barclays Bank's revenues grew 8% in 2011. Its Africa business performed relatively strongly, with credit impairments improving, as did Barclaycard, thanks to the portfolio acquisitions which delivered profits. That year the bank closed nearly 150 European branches (largely located in Spain), the costs of which contributed to a 5% decline in net income. – less\",\n",

       "   'description': \"Independent oil and gas producer Devon Energy puts its energy into oil and gas fields far from England's southwestern coast, in North America. It focuses on exploration and production assets in Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming, and western Canada. In 2011 Devon Energy reported proved reserves of 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent (58% natural gas) and more than 19,900 net acres of assets. It also drilled almost 2,500 gross wells. Devon Energy produces about 2.5 billion cu. ft. of natural gas a day (more than 3% of all the gas consumed in North America). The company is the largest producer and lease holder in the Barnett Shale (Texas) and is looking to replicate its success there to other unconventional plays.\\n\\nGeographic Reach\\n\\nOnce active in major oil patches worldwide such as Azerbaijan, Brazil, and China, in the mid-2000s the company decided to focus on safer and increasingly productive unconventional onshore exploration opportunities (shales and oil sands) in North America. As a result, Devon Energy has sold all of its international assets.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis\\n\\nDevon Energy posted a major improvement in revenues in 2010, thanks to higher commodity prices and an increase in production. In 2011, buoyed by record level reserves, high oil prices, and an increased demand for oil and gas products, the company posted a further 15% growth in revenues. Net income only rose by 3%, however, as higher operating, depreciation, deletion, and amortization costs and an increase in deferred income tax expense trimmed income growth.\\n\\nBoosting its financial resources, in 2012 Devon Energy secured a commitment from Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration & Production for the Chinese company to invest $2.2 billion in exchange for one-third of Devon's interest in five new joint venture plays in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, Niobrara, Mississippian, Ohio Utica Shale, and the Michigan Basin.\\n\\nThat year it also closed a similar $1.4 billion joint venture deal with Sumitomo Corp. to develop 650,000 net acres in the Cline Shale and the Midland-Wolfcamp Shale in West Texas.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nIn 2010 it sold most of its remaining international assets to BP for $7 billion. As part of this deal BP sold undeveloped oil sand leases in Canada to Devon Energy for $500 million and formed a joint venture with the company to exploit them. The company also sold its Panyu field, offshore China, to China National Offshore Oil for $515 million.\\n\\nConsolidating its North American assets to just its onshore properties, In 2010 Devon Energy sold its stakes in the Cascade, Jack and St. Malo fields in the Gulf of Mexico (about 200 million barrels of estimated recoverable reserves) to AP Moller-Maersk's oil unit for $1.3 billion. It also sold its remaining Gulf of Mexico shelf assets to Apache for $1 billion. – less\",\n",

       "   'description': \"When it comes to data storage, Western Digital has drive. The company is one of the largest independent makers of hard-disk drives, which record, store, and recall volumes of data. Drives for PCs account for most of Western Digital's sales, although the company also makes devices used in servers, cloud computing data centers, and home entertainment products such as set-top boxes and video game consoles. The company sells to manufacturers and through retailers and distributors. More than 60% of its sales are to OEMs such as  Hewlett-Packard, which is Western Digital's largest customer. The company gets more than half of its sales from the Asia/Pacific region.\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nWestern Digital is structured around two subsidiaries: WD Technologies and Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST). Each subsidiary maintains its own brand and product lines, with separate sales, marketing, operations, and product development teams. The company is looking to offer improved customer experiences for competing and complementary brands, while finding efficiencies in shared services.\\n\\nGeographic Reach\\n\\nThe company is seeing strong growth in Asia (which represents more than 55% of sales) and the US (nearly 20%), with slower growth in the EMEA region (another nearly 20%). Western Digital has manufacturing facilities in the US and across Asia and sales offices worldwide.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nWestern Digital is one of a handful of manufacturers that dominate the hard-disk drive market -- a sector characterized by harsh competition, short product life cycles, and aggressive price cuts. In order to reduce its dependence on drives for PCs, the company has branched into branded consumer media devices, including DVR expanders, portable media drives, and media players that let users play data from external drives on TV. Its WD TV Live Plus media player streams movies (including those offered by Netflix) and Internet video to a digital TV. It is also investing in products for the mobile computing and cloud computing markets.\\n\\nAnother promising market for Western Digital is nearline hard drives, which are more cost effective than traditional hard drives by providing more capacity while requiring lower power. Nearline hard drives are used for stimulated applications, such as video surveillance and medical imaging, and IT infrastructure applications, including scientific computing and Web search engines.\\n\\nMergers & Acquisitions\\n\\nIn 2012 Western Digital bought Hitachi's disk drive business, HGST, for around $4.3 billion in cash and stock. The deal boosts Western Digital's share of the global market to nearly 50%, ahead of rival Seagate Technology which accounts for around 30% of global shipments. Strategically, the deal adds disk drives used with servers -- a large part of both Hitachi and Seagate's businesses -- and gives Western Digital a better foothold in solid-state drives used in tablets and other portable devices. The acquisition also provides Western Digital its first manufacturing foothold in China and the Philippines. With the stock portion of the sale, Hitachi gains a 10% stake in Western Digital and two spots on the board of directors.\\n\\nWestern Digital has long used acquisitions to add new product lines and extend its geographic reach. Over the past several years it bought the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya for about $233 million and entered the market for solid-state drives with the $65 million purchase of SiliconSystems. In a large 2007 acquisition, Western Digital bought disk component maker Komag for $1 billion, which gave it the ability to manufacture the media and substrates used in its drives.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis\\n\\nWestern Digital's sales have fluctuated in recent years as it has dealt with the worldwide economic downturn. However, its acquisition of HGST helped produce strong results for fiscal 2012 (ended June 30). The company's revenues grew 31% that year to $12.5 billion, with HGST contributing more than $3 billion of that. It also saw an improvement in hard drive average selling price from $45 in fiscal 2011 to $62 in fiscal 2012.\\n\\nAlthough Western Digital saw increased R&D and SG&A expenses in 2012, the overall strength of revenues led to a 122% jump in net income (to $1.6 billion). – less\",\n",

In addition to auto coverage, the company provides a range of personal property/casualty and life insurance products to more than 3 million policyholders. Auto-Owners Insurance Group operates through subsidiaries including Auto-Owners Life Insurance, Home-Owners Insurance, and Property-Owners Insurance Company. Its Southern-Owners Insurance subsidiary offers property/casualty insurance in Florida. Auto-Owners Insurance also sells commercial auto, liability, and workers' compensation policies. Established in 1916, the company operates in 26 states nationwide and is represented by more than 6,000 independent agencies.\\n\\nGeographic Reach\\n\\nAuto-Owners operates 85 claims, underwriting, and marketing offices in its 26-state service territory. The company's largest markets are Florida and Michigan.\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nAuto-Owners' revenues come from insurance premiums, as well as investment income. The company's property/casualty business accounts for about 90% of revenues and 80% of profits, with the remainder coming from premiums and income from the life insurance segment.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis\\n\\nAuto-Owners reported a 5% increase in net written premiums in 2011 to nearly $5.2 billion, primarily due to growth within the Auto-Owners Insurance, Auto-Owners Life, and Home-Owners Insurance divisions. Total revenues were some $5.7 billion, while net income was reported at $69 million.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nAuto-Owners is focused on growing its business by establishing strong relationships with independent agents and by diversifying its product offerings. The company has also expanded by adding sales and service facilities in new and existing markets. In 2011 Auto-Owners opened five new branch locations to handle claims in Ashville, North Carolina; Kennesaw, Georgia; Little Rock, Arkansas; Madison, Wisconsin; and Sioux Falls, South Dakota. The Little Rock location also provides underwriting. New construction that year included a backup data center in Traverse City, Michigan, and offices in Broomfield, Colorado, and Columbia, Missouri, to replace existing branches. – less\",\n",

CenterPoint Energy's regulated utilities distribute natural gas to 3.3 million customers in six US states and electricity to more than 2 million customers on the Texas Gulf Coast. The company's main stomping ground is Texas, where it has regulated power distribution operations through subsidiary CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric. CenterPoint Energy operates more than 48,230 miles of power distribution lines, 8,000 miles of interstate gas pipeline, and 3,800 miles of gas gathering pipeline. It also provides natural gas field services. \\n\\nOperations\\n\\nThe company's natural gas distribution subsidiaries serve customers in Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas. (Texas represented 47% of all natural gas distribution customers in 2010). CenterPoint Energy also markets natural gas and related services to 12,200 commercial, industrial, and wholesale customers located primarily in the eastern US. It also provides HVAC and other energy-related services through its gas division.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis\\n\\nCenterPoint Energy's sales dropped dramatically in 2009 as the global recession prompted a slump in commodity prices which hurt the performance of its different energy segments. A reviving economy in 2010 led to a stronger demand for power and gas (coupled with rate increases and weather-related spikes in consumption) resulting in a overall jump in revenues and net income that year.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nCenterPoint Energy's strategy is focused on enhancing and expanding existing core operations, while acquiring complementary and synergistic businesses. In 2011 the company acquired Denver-based natural gas marketing firm Asgard Energy, which supplies gas to agricultural, commercial, industrial, and residential customers in five states (Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, and West Virginia). The acquisition fit into CenterPoint's strategy to expand into the Rockies and diversify into residential choice markets.\\n\\nIn 2012, to add to its midstream assets, CenterPoint Energy Field Services (CEFS), an indirect subsidiary of the company, acquired gathering and processing assets from Prism Gas Systems, a subsidiary of Martin Midstream Partners for $275 million. The assets include Prism's 50% stake in Texas-based Waskom Gas Processing Co. A CEFS subsidiary owns the other 50% stake in Waskom.  – less\",\n",

       "   'description': \"While the breaching whale logo used by Pacific Life Insurance evokes the West Coast, the company operates all across the US. As the primary operating subsidiary of Pacific Mutual Holding Company, Pacific Life offers a wide range of life insurance, asset management, and financial services products, including individual annuities and mutual funds. It also offers a variety of investment products and services for individuals, businesses, and pension plans. Subsidiary Pacific Life & Annuity offers the same mix of life insurance and investment products and services for individuals and businesses in New York. Pacific Life was founded in 1868.\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nPacific Life policyholders are members of parent Pacific Mutual Holding Company, which was created in 1997 following a conversion to the mutual holding company structure. Pacific LifeCorp is the intermediate stock holding company.\\n\\nWhile life insurance is the company's bread and butter, it has brought in other operations for variety. Pacific Life's Aviation Capital Group subsidiary leases commercial jets to 90 airlines in more than 40 countries. It also manages aircraft assets for third parties such as commercial airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and financial institutions. Other subsidiaries include Pacific Asset Management, which provides third-party institutional asset management.\\n\\nSales & Marketing\\n\\nPacific Life's insurance policies are sold through independent distributors and through dealer/broker subsidiary Pacific Select Distributors.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis\\n\\nThe company's growth strategies helped Pacific Life achieve strong results in 2011, with revenues increasing 15% over 2010 to almost 6.7 billion, and net income increasing 29% to $679 million. Its operating income climbed a whopping 40% over 2010 to reach $823 million. The gains achieved were attributed to enhanced service offerings, expanded life insurance, annuity, and mutual fund product offerings, and the two acquisitions made that year.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nBeing a mutual company, Pacific Life operates with a long-term focus to serve in the best interests of its policyholders and clients. in doing so, the company navigated the chilly economic waters of the 2008-2009 recession by steadily introducing new products and building up its capital reserves. By 2010 its net income had grown as risk-weary customers squirreled more of their savings and retirement monies into life insurance and mutual funds.\\n\\nMergers, Acquisitions & Divestitures\\n\\nIn 2008 the company added international reinsurance to its portfolio when it acquired the former London-based specialty reinsurance operations of Scottish Re and renamed the business as Pacific Life Re. It then added life retrocession (reinsurance of a reinsurer) to its line-up in 2011 by acquiring that business from Manulife and expanded its business to include the Toronto, Boston, Barbados, and Cologne markets.\\n\\nAlso in 2011 Pacific life bought JPMorgan Chase's pension risk advisory business to form Pacific Global Advisors. The unit offers risk management solutions and advisory services to pension plan sponsors.\\n\\nThe firm divested a noncore business, College Savings Bank, in 2012 to a syndicate of investors for an undisclosed price. The banking unit managed two state-sponsored 529 college savings plans. – less\",\n",

Other products include acetate tow (in cigarette filters); industrial specialties like ethylene vinyl aceta; and engineered plastics.

The largest gains were in its Industrial Specialties unit (up 18%), Advanced Engineered Materials unit (up 17%), and its Acetyl Intermediates segment (up 15%). Net income grew by 61% in 2011, as increased revenues outpaced a more modest growth in operating expenses.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nCelanese's strategy is to grow the company through expansion into emerging regions, particularly China; to offer innovation through developing new products and applications; increase its productivity through energy reduction, business process improvements, and manufacturing optimization; and boost its portfolio by growing its business through both acquisitions or internal growth.\\n\\nIn 2012 the company teamed up with Indonesia's Pertamina, forming a joint venture to develop fuel ethanol projects in that country.\\n\\nTo grow its emulsion polymers business, in 2011 the company acquired two product lines, Vinac and Flexbond, from Ashland. The acquisition is expected to speed up growth of the company's emulsion polymers operations throughout the Americas -- especially in the adhesives, textiles, coatings, and paper segments.\\n\\nCelanese subsidiary Ticona Engineering Polymers acquired two product lines, Zenite liquid crystal polymer and Thermx polycyclohexylene-dimethylene terephthalate, from DuPont Performance Polymers division in 2010.

It also engages in natural gas compressing, treating, processing, transporting, and selling. DCP Midstream LLC also transports and sells NGLs and distributes propane wholesale. The company operates natural gas gathering systems (5,300 miles of pipe) in eight states (including Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas), seven processing plants, four NGL pipelines, and nine propane storage terminals. Spectra Energy holds a 50% holding in DCP (ConocoPhillips holds the other 50%).\\n\\nA consolidator in the fragmented natural gas gathering, NGLs, and wholesale propane industry segments, the company has been expanding its gas supply base and its propane wholesale network in recent years through strategic complementary acquisitions and joint ventures.\\n\\nIn 2012 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Texas-based Crossroads processing plant and gathering system from Penn Virginia Resource Partners for $63 million. The bolt-on acquisition allows the company to expand its market position in East Texas and provide services to drillers in the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley regions.\\n\\nIn 2011 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Seaway Products Pipeline Co. from ConocoPhillips. The pipeline, now called Southern Hills Pipeline and being converted to NGL service, is expected to be operational by mid-2013. It will provide NGL access from the Midcontinent to the Texas Gulf Coast.\\n\\nThe company agreed to form a joint venture with EQT Corporation to develop natural gas processing and related natural gas liquid (NGL) infrastructure in the Marcellus and Huron shale plays in the Appalachian basin. (However, the parties could not come to agreement and dropped the plan in early 2011). In 2010, the company acquired the Liberty gathering system and south Raywood processing plant from Ceritas Energy in southeast Texas. The pipeline system interconnects with DCP Midstream's Centana Intrastate Pipeline system.\\n\\nExpanding in Michigan, in 2009 the company acquired gas gathering and treating assets for $45.1 million. In 2010 it acquired a 350-mile interstate natural gas liquids pipeline system in Colorado's Denver-Julesburg Basin from Buckeye Partners for $22 million.\\n\\nIn 2010 DCP Midstream Partners moved to extend its Northeast wholesale propane business into the MidAtlantic region, acquiring UGI's Atlantic Energy for $49 million. That year it also purchased of NGL storage company Marysville Hydrocarbon Holdings (in Michigan) for about $95 million.\\n\\nAlthough DCP Midstream Partners' revenues suffered in 2009 as a result of the global recession and lower commodity prices, acquisitions and organic growth managed to offset lower natural gas volumes.  Acquisitions, increased demand, higher commodity and propane prices, and gains on derivatives help to lift the company's revenues and net income in 2010.\\n\\nIn terms of the company's origins, the D in DCP Midstream Partners (formerly Duke Energy Field Services) is for Duke Energy; the CP, ConocoPhillips. These two energy majors formed DCP Midstream Partners in 2005. Following the spinoff of Spectra Energy from Duke Energy in 2007, Spectra Energy assumed Duke Energy's 50% holding in DCP. – less\",\n",

You’ll think differently, too.\\n\\nWe aren’t what you’d expect from an insurance company. Progressive is a place where people come for a job, but stay for a career. And we have the numbers to back it up: More than 5,000 Progressive people move levels within the company each year. We’re a diverse group, committed to our Core Values, community, and military employees. We strive to create a fun and flexible work environment for everyone where employees are encouraged to risk, learn, and grow. We’ve been named one of the top places to work in our major locations. We’re also a Fortune 500 company and have one of the largest contemporary art collections in the country.\\n\\nOur work culture\\n\\nOur name says it all. We’re Progressive. And we are progressive. We live and breathe our Core Values: Integrity, Golden Rule, Objectives, Excellence, and Profit. These values set our culture apart and support our belief that how we achieve something is just as important as what we achieve. And we carry these values out every day—they guide our business decisions and define how we treat each other, our customers, our business partners, and our investors.\\n\\nProgressive people work hard to keep us at the top of our industry, and are rewarded for it—with competitive pay, great benefits, the possibility of bonuses based on company performance, work-life balance opportunities, on-site fitness and health centers, and other special perks.\\n\\nAnd we know that cultivating a diverse, inclusive, and flexible work environment is critical to our achievements. That’s why we promote from within, work hard and get rewarded for it, and win the right way.\\n\\nOur Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) play a key part in leveraging our differences to support an inclusive culture and provide insight into our diverse customers. These groups provide development tools, networking opportunities, and interactive cultural celebrations that are just one piece of our open, supportive culture.\\n\\nWhether you’re new to the “real world” or have years of experience, Progressive could be a place where you stay and thrive.

       "   'description': \"DCP Midstream Partners is the publicly traded entity of DCP Midstream LLC, one of the largest natural gas gatherers in North America and also the top producer and one of the primary marketers of natural gas liquids (NGLs). It also engages in natural gas compressing, treating, processing, transporting, and selling. DCP Midstream LLC also transports and sells NGLs and distributes propane wholesale. The company operates natural gas gathering systems (5,300 miles of pipe) in eight states (including Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas), seven processing plants, four NGL pipelines, and nine propane storage terminals. Spectra Energy holds a 50% holding in DCP (ConocoPhillips holds the other 50%).\\n\\nA consolidator in the fragmented natural gas gathering, NGLs, and wholesale propane industry segments, the company has been expanding its gas supply base and its propane wholesale network in recent years through strategic complementary acquisitions and joint ventures.\\n\\nIn 2012 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Texas-based Crossroads processing plant and gathering system from Penn Virginia Resource Partners for $63 million. The bolt-on acquisition allows the company to expand its market position in East Texas and provide services to drillers in the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley regions.\\n\\nIn 2011 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Seaway Products Pipeline Co. from ConocoPhillips. The pipeline, now called Southern Hills Pipeline and being converted to NGL service, is expected to be operational by mid-2013. It will provide NGL access from the Midcontinent to the Texas Gulf Coast.\\n\\nThe company agreed to form a joint venture with EQT Corporation to develop natural gas processing and related natural gas liquid (NGL) infrastructure in the Marcellus and Huron shale plays in the Appalachian basin. (However, the parties could not come to agreement and dropped the plan in early 2011). In 2010, the company acquired the Liberty gathering system and south Raywood processing plant from Ceritas Energy in southeast Texas. The pipeline system interconnects with DCP Midstream's Centana Intrastate Pipeline system.\\n\\nExpanding in Michigan, in 2009 the company acquired gas gathering and treating assets for $45.1 million. In 2010 it acquired a 350-mile interstate natural gas liquids pipeline system in Colorado's Denver-Julesburg Basin from Buckeye Partners for $22 million.\\n\\nIn 2010 DCP Midstream Partners moved to extend its Northeast wholesale propane business into the MidAtlantic region, acquiring UGI's Atlantic Energy for $49 million. That year it also purchased of NGL storage company Marysville Hydrocarbon Holdings (in Michigan) for about $95 million.\\n\\nAlthough DCP Midstream Partners' revenues suffered in 2009 as a result of the global recession and lower commodity prices, acquisitions and organic growth managed to offset lower natural gas volumes.  Acquisitions, increased demand, higher commodity and propane prices, and gains on derivatives help to lift the company's revenues and net income in 2010.\\n\\nIn terms of the company's origins, the D in DCP Midstream Partners (formerly Duke Energy Field Services) is for Duke Energy; the CP, ConocoPhillips. These two energy majors formed DCP Midstream Partners in 2005. Following the spinoff of Spectra Energy from Duke Energy in 2007, Spectra Energy assumed Duke Energy's 50% holding in DCP. – less\",\n",

The company's main stomping ground is Texas, where it has regulated power distribution operations through subsidiary CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric.

It also provides HVAC and other energy-related services through its gas division.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis\\n\\nCenterPoint Energy's sales dropped dramatically in 2009 as the global recession prompted a slump in commodity prices which hurt the performance of its different energy segments. A reviving economy in 2010 led to a stronger demand for power and gas (coupled with rate increases and weather-related spikes in consumption) resulting in a overall jump in revenues and net income that year.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nCenterPoint Energy's strategy is focused on enhancing and expanding existing core operations, while acquiring complementary and synergistic businesses. In 2011 the company acquired Denver-based natural gas marketing firm Asgard Energy, which supplies gas to agricultural, commercial, industrial, and residential customers in five states (Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, and West Virginia). The acquisition fit into CenterPoint's strategy to expand into the Rockies and diversify into residential choice markets.\\n\\nIn 2012, to add to its midstream assets, CenterPoint Energy Field Services (CEFS), an indirect subsidiary of the company, acquired gathering and processing assets from Prism Gas Systems, a subsidiary of Martin Midstream Partners for $275 million.

       "   'description': \"While the breaching whale logo used by Pacific Life Insurance evokes the West Coast, the company operates all across the US. As the primary operating subsidiary of Pacific Mutual Holding Company, Pacific Life offers a wide range of life insurance, asset management, and financial services products, including individual annuities and mutual funds. It also offers a variety of investment products and services for individuals, businesses, and pension plans. Subsidiary Pacific Life & Annuity offers the same mix of life insurance and investment products and services for individuals and businesses in New York. Pacific Life was founded in 1868.\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nPacific Life policyholders are members of parent Pacific Mutual Holding Company, which was created in 1997 following a conversion to the mutual holding company structure. Pacific LifeCorp is the intermediate stock holding company.\\n\\nWhile life insurance is the company's bread and butter, it has brought in other operations for variety. Pacific Life's Aviation Capital Group subsidiary leases commercial jets to 90 airlines in more than 40 countries. It also manages aircraft assets for third parties such as commercial airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and financial institutions. Other subsidiaries include Pacific Asset Management, which provides third-party institutional asset management.\\n\\nSales & Marketing\\n\\nPacific Life's insurance policies are sold through independent distributors and through dealer/broker subsidiary Pacific Select Distributors.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis\\n\\nThe company's growth strategies helped Pacific Life achieve strong results in 2011, with revenues increasing 15% over 2010 to almost 6.7 billion, and net income increasing 29% to $679 million. Its operating income climbed a whopping 40% over 2010 to reach $823 million. The gains achieved were attributed to enhanced service offerings, expanded life insurance, annuity, and mutual fund product offerings, and the two acquisitions made that year.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nBeing a mutual company, Pacific Life operates with a long-term focus to serve in the best interests of its policyholders and clients. in doing so, the company navigated the chilly economic waters of the 2008-2009 recession by steadily introducing new products and building up its capital reserves. By 2010 its net income had grown as risk-weary customers squirreled more of their savings and retirement monies into life insurance and mutual funds.\\n\\nMergers, Acquisitions & Divestitures\\n\\nIn 2008 the company added international reinsurance to its portfolio when it acquired the former London-based specialty reinsurance operations of Scottish Re and renamed the business as Pacific Life Re. It then added life retrocession (reinsurance of a reinsurer) to its line-up in 2011 by acquiring that business from Manulife and expanded its business to include the Toronto, Boston, Barbados, and Cologne markets.\\n\\nAlso in 2011 Pacific life bought JPMorgan Chase's pension risk advisory business to form Pacific Global Advisors. The unit offers risk management solutions and advisory services to pension plan sponsors.\\n\\nThe firm divested a noncore business, College Savings Bank, in 2012 to a syndicate of investors for an undisclosed price. The banking unit managed two state-sponsored 529 college savings plans. – less\",\n",

       "   'description': \"When it comes to data storage, Western Digital has drive. The company is one of the largest independent makers of hard-disk drives, which record, store, and recall volumes of data. Drives for PCs account for most of Western Digital's sales, although the company also makes devices used in servers, cloud computing data centers, and home entertainment products such as set-top boxes and video game consoles. The company sells to manufacturers and through retailers and distributors. More than 60% of its sales are to OEMs such as  Hewlett-Packard, which is Western Digital's largest customer. The company gets more than half of its sales from the Asia/Pacific region.\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nWestern Digital is structured around two subsidiaries: WD Technologies and Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST). Each subsidiary maintains its own brand and product lines, with separate sales, marketing, operations, and product development teams. The company is looking to offer improved customer experiences for competing and complementary brands, while finding efficiencies in shared services.\\n\\nGeographic Reach\\n\\nThe company is seeing strong growth in Asia (which represents more than 55% of sales) and the US (nearly 20%), with slower growth in the EMEA region (another nearly 20%). Western Digital has manufacturing facilities in the US and across Asia and sales offices worldwide.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nWestern Digital is one of a handful of manufacturers that dominate the hard-disk drive market -- a sector characterized by harsh competition, short product life cycles, and aggressive price cuts. In order to reduce its dependence on drives for PCs, the company has branched into branded consumer media devices, including DVR expanders, portable media drives, and media players that let users play data from external drives on TV. Its WD TV Live Plus media player streams movies (including those offered by Netflix) and Internet video to a digital TV. It is also investing in products for the mobile computing and cloud computing markets.\\n\\nAnother promising market for Western Digital is nearline hard drives, which are more cost effective than traditional hard drives by providing more capacity while requiring lower power. Nearline hard drives are used for stimulated applications, such as video surveillance and medical imaging, and IT infrastructure applications, including scientific computing and Web search engines.\\n\\nMergers & Acquisitions\\n\\nIn 2012 Western Digital bought Hitachi's disk drive business, HGST, for around $4.3 billion in cash and stock. The deal boosts Western Digital's share of the global market to nearly 50%, ahead of rival Seagate Technology which accounts for around 30% of global shipments. Strategically, the deal adds disk drives used with servers -- a large part of both Hitachi and Seagate's businesses -- and gives Western Digital a better foothold in solid-state drives used in tablets and other portable devices. The acquisition also provides Western Digital its first manufacturing foothold in China and the Philippines. With the stock portion of the sale, Hitachi gains a 10% stake in Western Digital and two spots on the board of directors.\\n\\nWestern Digital has long used acquisitions to add new product lines and extend its geographic reach. Over the past several years it bought the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya for about $233 million and entered the market for solid-state drives with the $65 million purchase of SiliconSystems. In a large 2007 acquisition, Western Digital bought disk component maker Komag for $1 billion, which gave it the ability to manufacture the media and substrates used in its drives.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis\\n\\nWestern Digital's sales have fluctuated in recent years as it has dealt with the worldwide economic downturn. However, its acquisition of HGST helped produce strong results for fiscal 2012 (ended June 30). The company's revenues grew 31% that year to $12.5 billion, with HGST contributing more than $3 billion of that. It also saw an improvement in hard drive average selling price from $45 in fiscal 2011 to $62 in fiscal 2012.\\n\\nAlthough Western Digital saw increased R&D and SG&A expenses in 2012, the overall strength of revenues led to a 122% jump in net income (to $1.6 billion). – less\",\n",

CenterPoint Energy's regulated utilities distribute natural gas to 3.3 million customers in six US states and electricity to more than 2 million customers on the Texas Gulf Coast. The company's main stomping ground is Texas, where it has regulated power distribution operations through subsidiary CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric. CenterPoint Energy operates more than 48,230 miles of power distribution lines, 8,000 miles of interstate gas pipeline, and 3,800 miles of gas gathering pipeline. It also provides natural gas field services. \\n\\nOperations\\n\\nThe company's natural gas distribution subsidiaries serve customers in Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas. (Texas represented 47% of all natural gas distribution customers in 2010). CenterPoint Energy also markets natural gas and related services to 12,200 commercial, industrial, and wholesale customers located primarily in the eastern US. It also provides HVAC and other energy-related services through its gas division.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis\\n\\nCenterPoint Energy's sales dropped dramatically in 2009 as the global recession prompted a slump in commodity prices which hurt the performance of its different energy segments. A reviving economy in 2010 led to a stronger demand for power and gas (coupled with rate increases and weather-related spikes in consumption) resulting in a overall jump in revenues and net income that year.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nCenterPoint Energy's strategy is focused on enhancing and expanding existing core operations, while acquiring complementary and synergistic businesses. In 2011 the company acquired Denver-based natural gas marketing firm Asgard Energy, which supplies gas to agricultural, commercial, industrial, and residential customers in five states (Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, and West Virginia). The acquisition fit into CenterPoint's strategy to expand into the Rockies and diversify into residential choice markets.\\n\\nIn 2012, to add to its midstream assets, CenterPoint Energy Field Services (CEFS), an indirect subsidiary of the company, acquired gathering and processing assets from Prism Gas Systems, a subsidiary of Martin Midstream Partners for $275 million. The assets include Prism's 50% stake in Texas-based Waskom Gas Processing Co. A CEFS subsidiary owns the other 50% stake in Waskom.  – less\",\n",

       "   'description': \"When it comes to data storage, Western Digital has drive. The company is one of the largest independent makers of hard-disk drives, which record, store, and recall volumes of data. Drives for PCs account for most of Western Digital's sales, although the company also makes devices used in servers, cloud computing data centers, and home entertainment products such as set-top boxes and video game consoles. The company sells to manufacturers and through retailers and distributors. More than 60% of its sales are to OEMs such as  Hewlett-Packard, which is Western Digital's largest customer. The company gets more than half of its sales from the Asia/Pacific region.\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nWestern Digital is structured around two subsidiaries: WD Technologies and Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST). Each subsidiary maintains its own brand and product lines, with separate sales, marketing, operations, and product development teams. The company is looking to offer improved customer experiences for competing and complementary brands, while finding efficiencies in shared services.\\n\\nGeographic Reach\\n\\nThe company is seeing strong growth in Asia (which represents more than 55% of sales) and the US (nearly 20%), with slower growth in the EMEA region (another nearly 20%). Western Digital has manufacturing facilities in the US and across Asia and sales offices worldwide.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nWestern Digital is one of a handful of manufacturers that dominate the hard-disk drive market -- a sector characterized by harsh competition, short product life cycles, and aggressive price cuts. In order to reduce its dependence on drives for PCs, the company has branched into branded consumer media devices, including DVR expanders, portable media drives, and media players that let users play data from external drives on TV. Its WD TV Live Plus media player streams movies (including those offered by Netflix) and Internet video to a digital TV. It is also investing in products for the mobile computing and cloud computing markets.\\n\\nAnother promising market for Western Digital is nearline hard drives, which are more cost effective than traditional hard drives by providing more capacity while requiring lower power. Nearline hard drives are used for stimulated applications, such as video surveillance and medical imaging, and IT infrastructure applications, including scientific computing and Web search engines.\\n\\nMergers & Acquisitions\\n\\nIn 2012 Western Digital bought Hitachi's disk drive business, HGST, for around $4.3 billion in cash and stock. The deal boosts Western Digital's share of the global market to nearly 50%, ahead of rival Seagate Technology which accounts for around 30% of global shipments. Strategically, the deal adds disk drives used with servers -- a large part of both Hitachi and Seagate's businesses -- and gives Western Digital a better foothold in solid-state drives used in tablets and other portable devices. The acquisition also provides Western Digital its first manufacturing foothold in China and the Philippines. With the stock portion of the sale, Hitachi gains a 10% stake in Western Digital and two spots on the board of directors.\\n\\nWestern Digital has long used acquisitions to add new product lines and extend its geographic reach. Over the past several years it bought the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya for about $233 million and entered the market for solid-state drives with the $65 million purchase of SiliconSystems. In a large 2007 acquisition, Western Digital bought disk component maker Komag for $1 billion, which gave it the ability to manufacture the media and substrates used in its drives.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis\\n\\nWestern Digital's sales have fluctuated in recent years as it has dealt with the worldwide economic downturn. However, its acquisition of HGST helped produce strong results for fiscal 2012 (ended June 30). The company's revenues grew 31% that year to $12.5 billion, with HGST contributing more than $3 billion of that. It also saw an improvement in hard drive average selling price from $45 in fiscal 2011 to $62 in fiscal 2012.\\n\\nAlthough Western Digital saw increased R&D and SG&A expenses in 2012, the overall strength of revenues led to a 122% jump in net income (to $1.6 billion). – less\",\n",

Its Ameriprise Bank subsidiary offers deposits and loans. Ameriprise, which has about $630 billion of assets under management, distributes its products primarily through a network of more than 9,700 financial advisors.\\n\\nThe company has been sharpening its focus on its branded adviser network. It sold its Securities America independent broker-dealer subsidiary to Ladenburg Thalmann for some $150 million in 2011. Shortly before the sale of the troubled unit, Ameriprise agreed to pay $160 million to settle claims that Securities America brokers sold securities in fraudulent companies.\\n\\nAmeriprise has been steadily boosting its assets under management and growing its client base (focusing on the affluent and mass affluent with at least $100,000 in investable assets). The company also is focused on geographic areas where those clients are congregated and has closed or consolidated offices in areas with less potential. While Columbia Management covers Ameriprise's main asset management market in the US, the company is increasing its global presence through its Threadneedle brand overseas. Ameriprise plans to grow its asset management operations in Europe, as well as in Australia, the Middle East, and Asia.\\n\\nAmeriprise's strategies have paid off. Volatile financial market conditions, which negatively impacted all of the company's operations, led to a decline in revenue in 2008 and 2009. However, the company returned to success in 2010 and revenues grew by more than 20% that year. Poor economic conditions continued in 2011. However, Ameriprise's operating net revenues climbed that year by about 10%. The boost was due to strong growth in the company's fee-based advisory and asset management businesses.\\n\\nAmeriprise Financial, which was founded in 1894, was spun off from American Express in 2005. – less\",\n",

Steel has been making steel for more than a century, always with an eye on serving our customers’ needs in the most cost-effective ways possible. To ensure the company’s long-term success, we’re transforming through The Carnegie Way.\\n\\nThe Carnegie Way looks at all aspects of our business to find ways we can improve. That includes processes, products and our culture. Started in 2013, it provides employees with a structured way to identify solutions that create value, drive innovation and ignite change. The Carnegie Way is moving us in the right direction. The numbers prove it. In 2014, 2015 and 2016, we realized $575 million, $815 million and $745 million in Carnegie Way benefits. These figures represent sustainable improvements to our business, not temporary cost cuts.\\n\\nOur products remain the backbone of iconic landmarks across the United States. While the specific products we make today are different than in years past, what we make and why we do it are no less important. Steel surrounds us. It makes daily life safer, easier and better. And steel’s possibilities for the future are endless. – less',\n",

The PFG Customized distribution unit serves chain restaurants such as Cracker Barrel and Ruby Tuesday.

The company is owned by The Blackstone Group and Wellspring Capital Management, which took the business private in 2008.\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nWith the $1.3 billion buyout in 2008 PFG was merged with Colorado-based Vistar (which was already controlled by Blackstone) to create a giant in the foodservice distribution industry with tentacles reaching into several markets. The combined business continues to operate under the PFG name, although each unit maintains its own headquarters. Across the company's foodservice, Vistar, and customized distribution businesses PFG collectively delivers more than 98,000 national- and proprietary-branded food and food-related products to more than 128,000 customers.

The division's more than 41,000 customers, located in about 40 countries, include franchisees of such chains as Burger King, Popeyes (owned by AFC Enterprises), and Subway. It also serves contract foodservice operators, such as Compass Group North America.\\n\\nMergers and Acquisitions\\n\\nThe company moved to expand its broadline division in mid-2012 by acquiring Carolina-based rival Institution Food House from Alex Lee. It also entered into an agreement in late 2012 to buy independent broadline foodservice distributor Fox River Foods, which serves seven states primarily in the Upper Midwestern region. The deals followed PFG's purchase in 2010 of Ledyard Company, which serves central and northern California. To add breadth to its product offering at its New England and Ohio offices, PFG in 2010 bought out the assets of VME Distributors.

The company sells some 30 brands of cars and light trucks and offers vehicle financing. Chairman Smith, who runs Sonic Automotive with his son Scott, is also the majority owner of Speedway Motorsports, which operates more than half a dozen NASCAR auto racetracks.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis\\n\\nOverall, the company's revenues in 2011 accounted for some $7.8 billion versus around $3.6 billion in 2010. Net income came in at $77.6 million in 2011 compared to $95.9 million in 2010, a 15% decrease. In 2011 the impact of earthquakes and the tsunami that struck Japan disrupted the company's Japanese supply chain and vehicle production. Sonic's new vehicle revenues and gross margins were impacted, thus affecting net income. Sonics' new vehicle sales generated around $4.3 million (about 55% of revenues) in revenues in 2011; used vehicle sales accounted for some $2 million (around 25% of revenues), and the company's parts, service and collision segment accounted for around $1.2 million (some 15% of revenues) in revenues.\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nIn 2011 the company sold approximately 12.7 million new vehicles compared to 11.6 million vehicles sold in 2010, a year-over-year increase of some 10%. The company sells new vehicles, including luxury (BMW, Lexus, Land Rover, and Volvo), mid-line import (Honda, Nissan, and Toyota), and domestic brands (Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors). Its luxury brands generated some 50% of revenues in 2011; while the company's mid-line and domestic brands accounted for about 35% and 15%, respectively.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nAs part of the company's strategic plans, Sonic is primarily focused in growing its operations in metropolitan markets in the Southeast, Southwest, Midwest, and the West (California). The company's long-term growth strategy is to target luxury or mid-line import brands.\\n\\nOwnership\\n\\nThe Smiths control the company through their ownership of about 75% of Sonic Automotive's voting stock. – less\",\n",

Other products include acetate tow (in cigarette filters); industrial specialties like ethylene vinyl aceta; and engineered plastics. The bulk of sales come from the US and Germany. \\n\\nOperations\\n\\nCelanese operates through four business segments: Advanced Engineered Materials, Consumer Specialties, Industrial Specialties, and Acetyl Intermediates.

The largest gains were in its Industrial Specialties unit (up 18%), Advanced Engineered Materials unit (up 17%), and its Acetyl Intermediates segment (up 15%). Net income grew by 61% in 2011, as increased revenues outpaced a more modest growth in operating expenses.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nCelanese's strategy is to grow the company through expansion into emerging regions, particularly China; to offer innovation through developing new products and applications; increase its productivity through energy reduction, business process improvements, and manufacturing optimization; and boost its portfolio by growing its business through both acquisitions or internal growth.\\n\\nIn 2012 the company teamed up with Indonesia's Pertamina, forming a joint venture to develop fuel ethanol projects in that country.\\n\\nTo grow its emulsion polymers business, in 2011 the company acquired two product lines, Vinac and Flexbond, from Ashland. The acquisition is expected to speed up growth of the company's emulsion polymers operations throughout the Americas -- especially in the adhesives, textiles, coatings, and paper segments.\\n\\nCelanese subsidiary Ticona Engineering Polymers acquired two product lines, Zenite liquid crystal polymer and Thermx polycyclohexylene-dimethylene terephthalate, from DuPont Performance Polymers division in 2010. The units expanded Celanese's offerings in the electrical and electronics application segments of the global polymers market. \\n\\nOwnership\\n\\nIn 2012 Capital Research Global Investors owned about 11% of Celanese, with several other investment firms owning a smaller stakes.\\n\\nCompany Background\\n\\nCelanese Corporation was created in 2004 by the Blackstone Group, which had acquired a majority share in Celanese AG, turned it private, and then flipped it in a 2005 public offering.

       "   'description': \"Ameren provides the power that makes much of the American Midwest run. The holding company distributes electricity to 2.4 million customers and natural gas to 900,000 customers in Missouri and Illinois through utility subsidiaries. Ameren has a generating capacity of 16,000 MW (primarily coal-fired), most of which is controlled by utility Union Electric (which does business as Ameren Missouri) and nonregulated subsidiary AmerenEnergy Resources Generating Company. Ameren, which also supplies merchant generation power to third parties, operates a nuclear power facility, three hydroelectric plants, and several coal-fired plants and turbine combustion facilities. It also purchases power, including windpower.\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nIn addition to operating power plants, Ameren procures natural gas for its affiliated companies, builds new power plants, and provides long-term energy supply contracts. It also markets and trades electricity to wholesale and retail customers and provides risk management and other energy-related services.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis\\n\\nAmeren's overall revenues dipped in 2011. While increased rates helped to lift Ameren Missouri's revenues in 2011, Ameren Illinois' regulated segment and the merchant generation segment both reported a drop in revenues. In particular, low gas prices and a warm winter hurt gas revenues. However, lower purchased power and resale gas, coupled with a drop in goodwill, impairment, and other charges, helped to lift Ameren's net income for the year.\\n\\nFavorable weather conditions (which increased energy demand) and rate increases help to lift the company's revenues in 2010. However, impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets in the merchant generation segment (due to the sustained decline in market prices for electricity) dragged down Ameren's operating income.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nIn 2010 the company combined AmerenIP, AmerenCIPS, and AmerenCILCO into one entity, Ameren Illinois, in order to streamline operations and reduce confusion among customers. The three Illinois utilities have operated as a single business since 2004 and deliver energy to more than 1,100 communities. Ameren Illinois also operates some 21,400 miles of natural gas distribution and transmission lines.\\n\\nTo comply with federal requirements to separate ownership of power generation and transmission businesses, the operations of Ameren subsidiaries' transmission assets are under the control ofMidwest Independent Transmission System Operator, a regional transmission organization that coordinates power across 15 Midwestern states and one Canadian Province.  – less\",\n",

       "   'description': \"When it comes to data storage, Western Digital has drive. The company is one of the largest independent makers of hard-disk drives, which record, store, and recall volumes of data. Drives for PCs account for most of Western Digital's sales, although the company also makes devices used in servers, cloud computing data centers, and home entertainment products such as set-top boxes and video game consoles. The company sells to manufacturers and through retailers and distributors. More than 60% of its sales are to OEMs such as  Hewlett-Packard, which is Western Digital's largest customer. The company gets more than half of its sales from the Asia/Pacific region.\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nWestern Digital is structured around two subsidiaries: WD Technologies and Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST). Each subsidiary maintains its own brand and product lines, with separate sales, marketing, operations, and product development teams. The company is looking to offer improved customer experiences for competing and complementary brands, while finding efficiencies in shared services.\\n\\nGeographic Reach\\n\\nThe company is seeing strong growth in Asia (which represents more than 55% of sales) and the US (nearly 20%), with slower growth in the EMEA region (another nearly 20%). Western Digital has manufacturing facilities in the US and across Asia and sales offices worldwide.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nWestern Digital is one of a handful of manufacturers that dominate the hard-disk drive market -- a sector characterized by harsh competition, short product life cycles, and aggressive price cuts. In order to reduce its dependence on drives for PCs, the company has branched into branded consumer media devices, including DVR expanders, portable media drives, and media players that let users play data from external drives on TV. Its WD TV Live Plus media player streams movies (including those offered by Netflix) and Internet video to a digital TV. It is also investing in products for the mobile computing and cloud computing markets.\\n\\nAnother promising market for Western Digital is nearline hard drives, which are more cost effective than traditional hard drives by providing more capacity while requiring lower power. Nearline hard drives are used for stimulated applications, such as video surveillance and medical imaging, and IT infrastructure applications, including scientific computing and Web search engines.\\n\\nMergers & Acquisitions\\n\\nIn 2012 Western Digital bought Hitachi's disk drive business, HGST, for around $4.3 billion in cash and stock. The deal boosts Western Digital's share of the global market to nearly 50%, ahead of rival Seagate Technology which accounts for around 30% of global shipments. Strategically, the deal adds disk drives used with servers -- a large part of both Hitachi and Seagate's businesses -- and gives Western Digital a better foothold in solid-state drives used in tablets and other portable devices. The acquisition also provides Western Digital its first manufacturing foothold in China and the Philippines. With the stock portion of the sale, Hitachi gains a 10% stake in Western Digital and two spots on the board of directors.\\n\\nWestern Digital has long used acquisitions to add new product lines and extend its geographic reach. Over the past several years it bought the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya for about $233 million and entered the market for solid-state drives with the $65 million purchase of SiliconSystems. In a large 2007 acquisition, Western Digital bought disk component maker Komag for $1 billion, which gave it the ability to manufacture the media and substrates used in its drives.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis\\n\\nWestern Digital's sales have fluctuated in recent years as it has dealt with the worldwide economic downturn. However, its acquisition of HGST helped produce strong results for fiscal 2012 (ended June 30). The company's revenues grew 31% that year to $12.5 billion, with HGST contributing more than $3 billion of that. It also saw an improvement in hard drive average selling price from $45 in fiscal 2011 to $62 in fiscal 2012.\\n\\nAlthough Western Digital saw increased R&D and SG&A expenses in 2012, the overall strength of revenues led to a 122% jump in net income (to $1.6 billion). – less\",\n",

       "   'description': \"Independent oil and gas producer Devon Energy puts its energy into oil and gas fields far from England's southwestern coast, in North America. It focuses on exploration and production assets in Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming, and western Canada. In 2011 Devon Energy reported proved reserves of 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent (58% natural gas) and more than 19,900 net acres of assets. It also drilled almost 2,500 gross wells. Devon Energy produces about 2.5 billion cu. ft. of natural gas a day (more than 3% of all the gas consumed in North America). The company is the largest producer and lease holder in the Barnett Shale (Texas) and is looking to replicate its success there to other unconventional plays.\\n\\nGeographic Reach\\n\\nOnce active in major oil patches worldwide such as Azerbaijan, Brazil, and China, in the mid-2000s the company decided to focus on safer and increasingly productive unconventional onshore exploration opportunities (shales and oil sands) in North America. As a result, Devon Energy has sold all of its international assets.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis\\n\\nDevon Energy posted a major improvement in revenues in 2010, thanks to higher commodity prices and an increase in production. In 2011, buoyed by record level reserves, high oil prices, and an increased demand for oil and gas products, the company posted a further 15% growth in revenues. Net income only rose by 3%, however, as higher operating, depreciation, deletion, and amortization costs and an increase in deferred income tax expense trimmed income growth.\\n\\nBoosting its financial resources, in 2012 Devon Energy secured a commitment from Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration & Production for the Chinese company to invest $2.2 billion in exchange for one-third of Devon's interest in five new joint venture plays in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, Niobrara, Mississippian, Ohio Utica Shale, and the Michigan Basin.\\n\\nThat year it also closed a similar $1.4 billion joint venture deal with Sumitomo Corp. to develop 650,000 net acres in the Cline Shale and the Midland-Wolfcamp Shale in West Texas.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nIn 2010 it sold most of its remaining international assets to BP for $7 billion. As part of this deal BP sold undeveloped oil sand leases in Canada to Devon Energy for $500 million and formed a joint venture with the company to exploit them. The company also sold its Panyu field, offshore China, to China National Offshore Oil for $515 million.\\n\\nConsolidating its North American assets to just its onshore properties, In 2010 Devon Energy sold its stakes in the Cascade, Jack and St. Malo fields in the Gulf of Mexico (about 200 million barrels of estimated recoverable reserves) to AP Moller-Maersk's oil unit for $1.3 billion. It also sold its remaining Gulf of Mexico shelf assets to Apache for $1 billion. – less\",\n",

The PFG Customized distribution unit serves chain restaurants such as Cracker Barrel and Ruby Tuesday. PFG subsidiary Vistar is a distributor of candy, snacks, and convenience foods for vending operators, retailers, and concessions. The company is owned by The Blackstone Group and Wellspring Capital Management, which took the business private in 2008.\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nWith the $1.3 billion buyout in 2008 PFG was merged with Colorado-based Vistar (which was already controlled by Blackstone) to create a giant in the foodservice distribution industry with tentacles reaching into several markets. The combined business continues to operate under the PFG name, although each unit maintains its own headquarters. Across the company's foodservice, Vistar, and customized distribution businesses PFG collectively delivers more than 98,000 national- and proprietary-branded food and food-related products to more than 128,000 customers. As part of its operations, PFG maintains about 70 distribution centers and more than a dozen Merchant's Mart locations in the US.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nFor PFG's broadline Performance Foodservice division, the focus has been on building the range of products it distributes to existing customers while improving margins. The division's more than 41,000 customers, located in about 40 countries, include franchisees of such chains as Burger King, Popeyes (owned by AFC Enterprises), and Subway. It also serves contract foodservice operators, such as Compass Group North America.\\n\\nMergers and Acquisitions\\n\\nThe company moved to expand its broadline division in mid-2012 by acquiring Carolina-based rival Institution Food House from Alex Lee. It also entered into an agreement in late 2012 to buy independent broadline foodservice distributor Fox River Foods, which serves seven states primarily in the Upper Midwestern region. The deals followed PFG's purchase in 2010 of Ledyard Company, which serves central and northern California. To add breadth to its product offering at its New England and Ohio offices, PFG in 2010 bought out the assets of VME Distributors. The wholesale supplier catered to mobile caterers, office coffee services, schools, prisons, and vending operators that do business in New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. – less\",\n",

The company operates natural gas gathering systems (5,300 miles of pipe) in eight states (including Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas), seven processing plants, four NGL pipelines, and nine propane storage terminals. Spectra Energy holds a 50% holding in DCP (ConocoPhillips holds the other 50%).\\n\\nA consolidator in the fragmented natural gas gathering, NGLs, and wholesale propane industry segments, the company has been expanding its gas supply base and its propane wholesale network in recent years through strategic complementary acquisitions and joint ventures.\\n\\nIn 2012 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Texas-based Crossroads processing plant and gathering system from Penn Virginia Resource Partners for $63 million. The bolt-on acquisition allows the company to expand its market position in East Texas and provide services to drillers in the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley regions.\\n\\nIn 2011 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Seaway Products Pipeline Co. from ConocoPhillips. The pipeline, now called Southern Hills Pipeline and being converted to NGL service, is expected to be operational by mid-2013. It will provide NGL access from the Midcontinent to the Texas Gulf Coast.\\n\\nThe company agreed to form a joint venture with EQT Corporation to develop natural gas processing and related natural gas liquid (NGL) infrastructure in the Marcellus and Huron shale plays in the Appalachian basin. (However, the parties could not come to agreement and dropped the plan in early 2011). In 2010, the company acquired the Liberty gathering system and south Raywood processing plant from Ceritas Energy in southeast Texas. The pipeline system interconnects with DCP Midstream's Centana Intrastate Pipeline system.\\n\\nExpanding in Michigan, in 2009 the company acquired gas gathering and treating assets for $45.1 million. In 2010 it acquired a 350-mile interstate natural gas liquids pipeline system in Colorado's Denver-Julesburg Basin from Buckeye Partners for $22 million.\\n\\nIn 2010 DCP Midstream Partners moved to extend its Northeast wholesale propane business into the MidAtlantic region, acquiring UGI's Atlantic Energy for $49 million. That year it also purchased of NGL storage company Marysville Hydrocarbon Holdings (in Michigan) for about $95 million.\\n\\nAlthough DCP Midstream Partners' revenues suffered in 2009 as a result of the global recession and lower commodity prices, acquisitions and organic growth managed to offset lower natural gas volumes.

       "   'description': \"When it comes to data storage, Western Digital has drive. The company is one of the largest independent makers of hard-disk drives, which record, store, and recall volumes of data. Drives for PCs account for most of Western Digital's sales, although the company also makes devices used in servers, cloud computing data centers, and home entertainment products such as set-top boxes and video game consoles. The company sells to manufacturers and through retailers and distributors. More than 60% of its sales are to OEMs such as  Hewlett-Packard, which is Western Digital's largest customer. The company gets more than half of its sales from the Asia/Pacific region.\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nWestern Digital is structured around two subsidiaries: WD Technologies and Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST). Each subsidiary maintains its own brand and product lines, with separate sales, marketing, operations, and product development teams. The company is looking to offer improved customer experiences for competing and complementary brands, while finding efficiencies in shared services.\\n\\nGeographic Reach\\n\\nThe company is seeing strong growth in Asia (which represents more than 55% of sales) and the US (nearly 20%), with slower growth in the EMEA region (another nearly 20%). Western Digital has manufacturing facilities in the US and across Asia and sales offices worldwide.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nWestern Digital is one of a handful of manufacturers that dominate the hard-disk drive market -- a sector characterized by harsh competition, short product life cycles, and aggressive price cuts. In order to reduce its dependence on drives for PCs, the company has branched into branded consumer media devices, including DVR expanders, portable media drives, and media players that let users play data from external drives on TV. Its WD TV Live Plus media player streams movies (including those offered by Netflix) and Internet video to a digital TV. It is also investing in products for the mobile computing and cloud computing markets.\\n\\nAnother promising market for Western Digital is nearline hard drives, which are more cost effective than traditional hard drives by providing more capacity while requiring lower power. Nearline hard drives are used for stimulated applications, such as video surveillance and medical imaging, and IT infrastructure applications, including scientific computing and Web search engines.\\n\\nMergers & Acquisitions\\n\\nIn 2012 Western Digital bought Hitachi's disk drive business, HGST, for around $4.3 billion in cash and stock. The deal boosts Western Digital's share of the global market to nearly 50%, ahead of rival Seagate Technology which accounts for around 30% of global shipments. Strategically, the deal adds disk drives used with servers -- a large part of both Hitachi and Seagate's businesses -- and gives Western Digital a better foothold in solid-state drives used in tablets and other portable devices. The acquisition also provides Western Digital its first manufacturing foothold in China and the Philippines. With the stock portion of the sale, Hitachi gains a 10% stake in Western Digital and two spots on the board of directors.\\n\\nWestern Digital has long used acquisitions to add new product lines and extend its geographic reach. Over the past several years it bought the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya for about $233 million and entered the market for solid-state drives with the $65 million purchase of SiliconSystems. In a large 2007 acquisition, Western Digital bought disk component maker Komag for $1 billion, which gave it the ability to manufacture the media and substrates used in its drives.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis\\n\\nWestern Digital's sales have fluctuated in recent years as it has dealt with the worldwide economic downturn. However, its acquisition of HGST helped produce strong results for fiscal 2012 (ended June 30). The company's revenues grew 31% that year to $12.5 billion, with HGST contributing more than $3 billion of that. It also saw an improvement in hard drive average selling price from $45 in fiscal 2011 to $62 in fiscal 2012.\\n\\nAlthough Western Digital saw increased R&D and SG&A expenses in 2012, the overall strength of revenues led to a 122% jump in net income (to $1.6 billion). – less\",\n",

Operating in a 24,000-square mile service territory, Duke Energy Carolinas has 101,400 miles of distribution cable. Its transmission system spans 13,100 miles. The utility has a net generating capacity of about 19,200 MW from interests in fossil-fueled, nuclear, and hydroelectric power plants. Duke Energy Carolinas also sells power to wholesale customers.\\n\\nThe utility's three nuclear plants account for more than a quarter of Duke Energy Carolinas' generating capacity.\\n\\nDuke Energy Carolinas is investing $7 billion from 2010 to 2012 to expand its generating capacity and maintain its nuclear fuel and plants. By 2020 the company is looking to expand capacity by 5,400 MW, a strategy that brings new plants online while replacing older, less efficient ones.\\n\\nThe global recession produced weaker demand for power (especially from industrial customers) which lowered company revenues in 2009. However, the same downturn cut fuel expenses (including purchased power from third parties) resulting in only a slight dip in Duke Energy Carolinas' operating income.\\n\\nIn 2010 the company saw its revenues rise, primarily due to new retail electric base rates in North Carolina and South Carolina, and favorable weather conditions which spurred demand. Duke Energy Carolinas also posted higher net income, despite an increase in fuel costs and expenses related to an employee voluntary severance plan. – less\",\n",

It also engages in natural gas compressing, treating, processing, transporting, and selling. DCP Midstream LLC also transports and sells NGLs and distributes propane wholesale. The company operates natural gas gathering systems (5,300 miles of pipe) in eight states (including Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas), seven processing plants, four NGL pipelines, and nine propane storage terminals. Spectra Energy holds a 50% holding in DCP (ConocoPhillips holds the other 50%).\\n\\nA consolidator in the fragmented natural gas gathering, NGLs, and wholesale propane industry segments, the company has been expanding its gas supply base and its propane wholesale network in recent years through strategic complementary acquisitions and joint ventures.\\n\\nIn 2012 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Texas-based Crossroads processing plant and gathering system from Penn Virginia Resource Partners for $63 million. The bolt-on acquisition allows the company to expand its market position in East Texas and provide services to drillers in the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley regions.\\n\\nIn 2011 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Seaway Products Pipeline Co. from ConocoPhillips. The pipeline, now called Southern Hills Pipeline and being converted to NGL service, is expected to be operational by mid-2013. It will provide NGL access from the Midcontinent to the Texas Gulf Coast.\\n\\nThe company agreed to form a joint venture with EQT Corporation to develop natural gas processing and related natural gas liquid (NGL) infrastructure in the Marcellus and Huron shale plays in the Appalachian basin. (However, the parties could not come to agreement and dropped the plan in early 2011). In 2010, the company acquired the Liberty gathering system and south Raywood processing plant from Ceritas Energy in southeast Texas. The pipeline system interconnects with DCP Midstream's Centana Intrastate Pipeline system.\\n\\nExpanding in Michigan, in 2009 the company acquired gas gathering and treating assets for $45.1 million. In 2010 it acquired a 350-mile interstate natural gas liquids pipeline system in Colorado's Denver-Julesburg Basin from Buckeye Partners for $22 million.\\n\\nIn 2010 DCP Midstream Partners moved to extend its Northeast wholesale propane business into the MidAtlantic region, acquiring UGI's Atlantic Energy for $49 million. That year it also purchased of NGL storage company Marysville Hydrocarbon Holdings (in Michigan) for about $95 million.\\n\\nAlthough DCP Midstream Partners' revenues suffered in 2009 as a result of the global recession and lower commodity prices, acquisitions and organic growth managed to offset lower natural gas volumes.  Acquisitions, increased demand, higher commodity and propane prices, and gains on derivatives help to lift the company's revenues and net income in 2010.\\n\\nIn terms of the company's origins, the D in DCP Midstream Partners (formerly Duke Energy Field Services) is for Duke Energy; the CP, ConocoPhillips. These two energy majors formed DCP Midstream Partners in 2005. Following the spinoff of Spectra Energy from Duke Energy in 2007, Spectra Energy assumed Duke Energy's 50% holding in DCP. – less\",\n",

It focuses on exploration and production assets in Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming, and western Canada. In 2011 Devon Energy reported proved reserves of 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent (58% natural gas) and more than 19,900 net acres of assets. It also drilled almost 2,500 gross wells. Devon Energy produces about 2.5 billion cu. ft. of natural gas a day (more than 3% of all the gas consumed in North America). The company is the largest producer and lease holder in the Barnett Shale (Texas) and is looking to replicate its success there to other unconventional plays.\\n\\nGeographic Reach\\n\\nOnce active in major oil patches worldwide such as Azerbaijan, Brazil, and China, in the mid-2000s the company decided to focus on safer and increasingly productive unconventional onshore exploration opportunities (shales and oil sands) in North America. As a result, Devon Energy has sold all of its international assets.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis\\n\\nDevon Energy posted a major improvement in revenues in 2010, thanks to higher commodity prices and an increase in production. In 2011, buoyed by record level reserves, high oil prices, and an increased demand for oil and gas products, the company posted a further 15% growth in revenues. Net income only rose by 3%, however, as higher operating, depreciation, deletion, and amortization costs and an increase in deferred income tax expense trimmed income growth.\\n\\nBoosting its financial resources, in 2012 Devon Energy secured a commitment from Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration & Production for the Chinese company to invest $2.2 billion in exchange for one-third of Devon's interest in five new joint venture plays in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, Niobrara, Mississippian, Ohio Utica Shale, and the Michigan Basin.\\n\\nThat year it also closed a similar $1.4 billion joint venture deal with Sumitomo Corp. to develop 650,000 net acres in the Cline Shale and the Midland-Wolfcamp Shale in West Texas.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nIn 2010 it sold most of its remaining international assets to BP for $7 billion. As part of this deal BP sold undeveloped oil sand leases in Canada to Devon Energy for $500 million and formed a joint venture with the company to exploit them.

The holding company distributes electricity to 2.4 million customers and natural gas to 900,000 customers in Missouri and Illinois through utility subsidiaries. Ameren has a generating capacity of 16,000 MW (primarily coal-fired), most of which is controlled by utility Union Electric (which does business as Ameren Missouri) and nonregulated subsidiary AmerenEnergy Resources Generating Company. Ameren, which also supplies merchant generation power to third parties, operates a nuclear power facility, three hydroelectric plants, and several coal-fired plants and turbine combustion facilities. It also purchases power, including windpower.\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nIn addition to operating power plants, Ameren procures natural gas for its affiliated companies, builds new power plants, and provides long-term energy supply contracts. It also markets and trades electricity to wholesale and retail customers and provides risk management and other energy-related services.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis\\n\\nAmeren's overall revenues dipped in 2011. While increased rates helped to lift Ameren Missouri's revenues in 2011, Ameren Illinois' regulated segment and the merchant generation segment both reported a drop in revenues. In particular, low gas prices and a warm winter hurt gas revenues. However, lower purchased power and resale gas, coupled with a drop in goodwill, impairment, and other charges, helped to lift Ameren's net income for the year.\\n\\nFavorable weather conditions (which increased energy demand) and rate increases help to lift the company's revenues in 2010. However, impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets in the merchant generation segment (due to the sustained decline in market prices for electricity) dragged down Ameren's operating income.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nIn 2010 the company combined AmerenIP, AmerenCIPS, and AmerenCILCO into one entity, Ameren Illinois, in order to streamline operations and reduce confusion among customers. The three Illinois utilities have operated as a single business since 2004 and deliver energy to more than 1,100 communities. Ameren Illinois also operates some 21,400 miles of natural gas distribution and transmission lines.\\n\\nTo comply with federal requirements to separate ownership of power generation and transmission businesses, the operations of Ameren subsidiaries' transmission assets are under the control ofMidwest Independent Transmission System Operator, a regional transmission organization that coordinates power across 15 Midwestern states and one Canadian Province.  – less\",\n",

       "   'description': \"When it comes to data storage, Western Digital has drive. The company is one of the largest independent makers of hard-disk drives, which record, store, and recall volumes of data. Drives for PCs account for most of Western Digital's sales, although the company also makes devices used in servers, cloud computing data centers, and home entertainment products such as set-top boxes and video game consoles. The company sells to manufacturers and through retailers and distributors. More than 60% of its sales are to OEMs such as  Hewlett-Packard, which is Western Digital's largest customer. The company gets more than half of its sales from the Asia/Pacific region.\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nWestern Digital is structured around two subsidiaries: WD Technologies and Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST). Each subsidiary maintains its own brand and product lines, with separate sales, marketing, operations, and product development teams. The company is looking to offer improved customer experiences for competing and complementary brands, while finding efficiencies in shared services.\\n\\nGeographic Reach\\n\\nThe company is seeing strong growth in Asia (which represents more than 55% of sales) and the US (nearly 20%), with slower growth in the EMEA region (another nearly 20%). Western Digital has manufacturing facilities in the US and across Asia and sales offices worldwide.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nWestern Digital is one of a handful of manufacturers that dominate the hard-disk drive market -- a sector characterized by harsh competition, short product life cycles, and aggressive price cuts. In order to reduce its dependence on drives for PCs, the company has branched into branded consumer media devices, including DVR expanders, portable media drives, and media players that let users play data from external drives on TV. Its WD TV Live Plus media player streams movies (including those offered by Netflix) and Internet video to a digital TV. It is also investing in products for the mobile computing and cloud computing markets.\\n\\nAnother promising market for Western Digital is nearline hard drives, which are more cost effective than traditional hard drives by providing more capacity while requiring lower power. Nearline hard drives are used for stimulated applications, such as video surveillance and medical imaging, and IT infrastructure applications, including scientific computing and Web search engines.\\n\\nMergers & Acquisitions\\n\\nIn 2012 Western Digital bought Hitachi's disk drive business, HGST, for around $4.3 billion in cash and stock. The deal boosts Western Digital's share of the global market to nearly 50%, ahead of rival Seagate Technology which accounts for around 30% of global shipments. Strategically, the deal adds disk drives used with servers -- a large part of both Hitachi and Seagate's businesses -- and gives Western Digital a better foothold in solid-state drives used in tablets and other portable devices. The acquisition also provides Western Digital its first manufacturing foothold in China and the Philippines. With the stock portion of the sale, Hitachi gains a 10% stake in Western Digital and two spots on the board of directors.\\n\\nWestern Digital has long used acquisitions to add new product lines and extend its geographic reach. Over the past several years it bought the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya for about $233 million and entered the market for solid-state drives with the $65 million purchase of SiliconSystems. In a large 2007 acquisition, Western Digital bought disk component maker Komag for $1 billion, which gave it the ability to manufacture the media and substrates used in its drives.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis\\n\\nWestern Digital's sales have fluctuated in recent years as it has dealt with the worldwide economic downturn. However, its acquisition of HGST helped produce strong results for fiscal 2012 (ended June 30). The company's revenues grew 31% that year to $12.5 billion, with HGST contributing more than $3 billion of that. It also saw an improvement in hard drive average selling price from $45 in fiscal 2011 to $62 in fiscal 2012.\\n\\nAlthough Western Digital saw increased R&D and SG&A expenses in 2012, the overall strength of revenues led to a 122% jump in net income (to $1.6 billion). – less\",\n",

The PFG Customized distribution unit serves chain restaurants such as Cracker Barrel and Ruby Tuesday. PFG subsidiary Vistar is a distributor of candy, snacks, and convenience foods for vending operators, retailers, and concessions. The company is owned by The Blackstone Group and Wellspring Capital Management, which took the business private in 2008.\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nWith the $1.3 billion buyout in 2008 PFG was merged with Colorado-based Vistar (which was already controlled by Blackstone) to create a giant in the foodservice distribution industry with tentacles reaching into several markets. The combined business continues to operate under the PFG name, although each unit maintains its own headquarters. Across the company's foodservice, Vistar, and customized distribution businesses PFG collectively delivers more than 98,000 national- and proprietary-branded food and food-related products to more than 128,000 customers. As part of its operations, PFG maintains about 70 distribution centers and more than a dozen Merchant's Mart locations in the US.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nFor PFG's broadline Performance Foodservice division, the focus has been on building the range of products it distributes to existing customers while improving margins. The division's more than 41,000 customers, located in about 40 countries, include franchisees of such chains as Burger King, Popeyes (owned by AFC Enterprises), and Subway. It also serves contract foodservice operators, such as Compass Group North America.\\n\\nMergers and Acquisitions\\n\\nThe company moved to expand its broadline division in mid-2012 by acquiring Carolina-based rival Institution Food House from Alex Lee. It also entered into an agreement in late 2012 to buy independent broadline foodservice distributor Fox River Foods, which serves seven states primarily in the Upper Midwestern region. The deals followed PFG's purchase in 2010 of Ledyard Company, which serves central and northern California. To add breadth to its product offering at its New England and Ohio offices, PFG in 2010 bought out the assets of VME Distributors. The wholesale supplier catered to mobile caterers, office coffee services, schools, prisons, and vending operators that do business in New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. – less\",\n",

The holding company distributes electricity to 2.4 million customers and natural gas to 900,000 customers in Missouri and Illinois through utility subsidiaries. Ameren has a generating capacity of 16,000 MW (primarily coal-fired), most of which is controlled by utility Union Electric (which does business as Ameren Missouri) and nonregulated subsidiary AmerenEnergy Resources Generating Company. Ameren, which also supplies merchant generation power to third parties, operates a nuclear power facility, three hydroelectric plants, and several coal-fired plants and turbine combustion facilities. It also purchases power, including windpower.\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nIn addition to operating power plants, Ameren procures natural gas for its affiliated companies, builds new power plants, and provides long-term energy supply contracts. It also markets and trades electricity to wholesale and retail customers and provides risk management and other energy-related services.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis\\n\\nAmeren's overall revenues dipped in 2011. While increased rates helped to lift Ameren Missouri's revenues in 2011, Ameren Illinois' regulated segment and the merchant generation segment both reported a drop in revenues. In particular, low gas prices and a warm winter hurt gas revenues. However, lower purchased power and resale gas, coupled with a drop in goodwill, impairment, and other charges, helped to lift Ameren's net income for the year.\\n\\nFavorable weather conditions (which increased energy demand) and rate increases help to lift the company's revenues in 2010. However, impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets in the merchant generation segment (due to the sustained decline in market prices for electricity) dragged down Ameren's operating income.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nIn 2010 the company combined AmerenIP, AmerenCIPS, and AmerenCILCO into one entity, Ameren Illinois, in order to streamline operations and reduce confusion among customers. The three Illinois utilities have operated as a single business since 2004 and deliver energy to more than 1,100 communities. Ameren Illinois also operates some 21,400 miles of natural gas distribution and transmission lines.\\n\\nTo comply with federal requirements to separate ownership of power generation and transmission businesses, the operations of Ameren subsidiaries' transmission assets are under the control ofMidwest Independent Transmission System Operator, a regional transmission organization that coordinates power across 15 Midwestern states and one Canadian Province.  – less\",\n",

The PFG Customized distribution unit serves chain restaurants such as Cracker Barrel and Ruby Tuesday. PFG subsidiary Vistar is a distributor of candy, snacks, and convenience foods for vending operators, retailers, and concessions. The company is owned by The Blackstone Group and Wellspring Capital Management, which took the business private in 2008.\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nWith the $1.3 billion buyout in 2008 PFG was merged with Colorado-based Vistar (which was already controlled by Blackstone) to create a giant in the foodservice distribution industry with tentacles reaching into several markets. The combined business continues to operate under the PFG name, although each unit maintains its own headquarters. Across the company's foodservice, Vistar, and customized distribution businesses PFG collectively delivers more than 98,000 national- and proprietary-branded food and food-related products to more than 128,000 customers. As part of its operations, PFG maintains about 70 distribution centers and more than a dozen Merchant's Mart locations in the US.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nFor PFG's broadline Performance Foodservice division, the focus has been on building the range of products it distributes to existing customers while improving margins. The division's more than 41,000 customers, located in about 40 countries, include franchisees of such chains as Burger King, Popeyes (owned by AFC Enterprises), and Subway. It also serves contract foodservice operators, such as Compass Group North America.\\n\\nMergers and Acquisitions\\n\\nThe company moved to expand its broadline division in mid-2012 by acquiring Carolina-based rival Institution Food House from Alex Lee. It also entered into an agreement in late 2012 to buy independent broadline foodservice distributor Fox River Foods, which serves seven states primarily in the Upper Midwestern region. The deals followed PFG's purchase in 2010 of Ledyard Company, which serves central and northern California. To add breadth to its product offering at its New England and Ohio offices, PFG in 2010 bought out the assets of VME Distributors. The wholesale supplier catered to mobile caterers, office coffee services, schools, prisons, and vending operators that do business in New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. – less\",\n",

Barclays Bank offers standard retail services such as deposit accounts and lending, including Woolwich-brand mortgages. The bank also provides commercial money transfer services, insurance products, the Barclaycard line of credit cards, and financial advisory services. Barclays Bank traces its roots to the late 17th century.\\n\\nBarclays Bank has been building up its portfolio of global credit card accounts, especially as other financial groups sell off noncore units during the economic recovery. In 2010 the company acquired the Italian credit card accounts of Citigroup in a deal that included some 197,000 card accounts and approximately €234 million ($320 million) worth of assets. It previously bought Goldfish, the struggling UK credit card unit of Discover Financial Services, for some £46 million ($70 million). In 2011 Barclays acquired Egg UK's credit card portfolio, which added more than 1 million accounts; it has agreed to buy more Citibank card accounts.\\n\\nThe bank has also been offloading some of its own holdings as part of an overall corporate restructuring. In 2010 Barclays sold its US subprime loan servicing business, HomEq Servicing, to Ocwen Financial. It also announced plans to abandon retail banking in certain international markets and instead focus on wholesale and commercial banking. In 2011 it shuttered its Indonesian retail unit Bank Akita, which it had acquired only two years before. The company also sold its Russian retail and commercial operations to a group of investors, citing difficulties competing in the market. Barclays will instead focus on its investment banking activities in the region.\\n\\nIn 2010 Barclays acquired Standard Life Bank from Standard Life for £226 million ($369 million). The deal added Standard Life's savings and mortgage books to the Barclays fold. Also as part of the deal, Barclays and Standard Life entered into a partnership whereby Barclays markets pension products to its clients.\\n\\nDespite challenges in the economy, especially in regards to Europe's debt problems, Barclays Bank's revenues grew 8% in 2011. Its Africa business performed relatively strongly, with credit impairments improving, as did Barclaycard, thanks to the portfolio acquisitions which delivered profits. That year the bank closed nearly 150 European branches (largely located in Spain), the costs of which contributed to a 5% decline in net income. – less\",\n",

It was also assisted by a 3.7% increase in the electric segment due to cost recovery of the acquisition of the Rocky Mountain and Blue Spruce natural gas facilities by Public Service Company of Colorado and by natural gas retail rate increases in Minnesota.\\n\\nNet income rose by 11% thanks to higher revenues and lower electric fuel and purchased power costs.\\n\\nHigher rates and increased weather-related demand helped sales in 2010 to rise nearly 7%, going from $9.6 billion to about $10.3 billion. \\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nXcel is an energy company in transition, with long-term plans to move from coal-fired plants to natural gas, and on to alternative fuels such as wind, solar, and biomass to boost its green  power capacity (88,705 MWh by 2015).\\n\\nIn 2012 the company was seeking proposals for renewable resources other than wind or solar as part of its plan to diversify Southwestern Public Service Company  renewable energy portfolio.\\n\\nAs the largest US utility wind energy provider, Xcel controlled some 3,500 MW of wind energy in its portfolio in 2011 and plans to have 7,400 MW by 2020. In 2011 Xcel bought the 200 MW Limon Wind Energy Center, which will have 125 turbines in Lincoln and Elbert counties on Colorado\\'s Front Range east of Denver. The company is also the US\\'s fifth-largest utility solar energy provider and owns the fourth-largest transmission system. In addition, Xcel operates more than 25 hydroelectric power plants in Colorado, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.\\n\\nThe company believes its strategy of making environmentally sound investments is pivotal to its success. Among its 2010 projects were launching its 800-MW coal-fired unit in Colorado, known as Comanche 3, after installing advanced emission-reduction equipment. It also began construction of its CapX2020 project, a joint venture transmission expansion project with 10 other utilities, scheduled for completion by 2020. The project includes a 240-mile transmission line from Minnesota to North Dakota. The company has filed to extend the licensing plants of its two nuclear plants on Prairie Island in Minnesota for 20 years, which it expects to save customers more than $1 billion compared to alternative sources.\\n\\nXcel plans to construct one of the largest biomass generating plants in the Midwest. The facility, proposed for the Bay Front Generating Station in Ashland, Wisconsin, will generate power from burning wood waste in all three operating units by 2014. In 2011 Xcel had 73 MW of biomass generating power in Minnesota and Wisconsin.\\n\\nXcel is also working to develop so-called \"smart grid\" technology, which will provide customers with more reliability and control over their energy use. It has completed the nation\\'s first fully integrated SmartGridCity in Boulder, Colorado.\\n\\nIn 2010 Xcel acquired two gas-fired power plants from Calpine Corporation for $739 million. The two Denver-area plants have a generating capacity of more than 900 MW and were already providing power to Public Service Company of Colorado under a contract agreement. The company is planning to acquire 775 MW of new wind-power capacity for its Colorado system over the next several years. – less',\n",

       "   'description': \"Independent oil and gas producer Devon Energy puts its energy into oil and gas fields far from England's southwestern coast, in North America. It focuses on exploration and production assets in Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming, and western Canada. In 2011 Devon Energy reported proved reserves of 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent (58% natural gas) and more than 19,900 net acres of assets. It also drilled almost 2,500 gross wells. Devon Energy produces about 2.5 billion cu. ft. of natural gas a day (more than 3% of all the gas consumed in North America). The company is the largest producer and lease holder in the Barnett Shale (Texas) and is looking to replicate its success there to other unconventional plays.\\n\\nGeographic Reach\\n\\nOnce active in major oil patches worldwide such as Azerbaijan, Brazil, and China, in the mid-2000s the company decided to focus on safer and increasingly productive unconventional onshore exploration opportunities (shales and oil sands) in North America. As a result, Devon Energy has sold all of its international assets.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis\\n\\nDevon Energy posted a major improvement in revenues in 2010, thanks to higher commodity prices and an increase in production. In 2011, buoyed by record level reserves, high oil prices, and an increased demand for oil and gas products, the company posted a further 15% growth in revenues. Net income only rose by 3%, however, as higher operating, depreciation, deletion, and amortization costs and an increase in deferred income tax expense trimmed income growth.\\n\\nBoosting its financial resources, in 2012 Devon Energy secured a commitment from Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration & Production for the Chinese company to invest $2.2 billion in exchange for one-third of Devon's interest in five new joint venture plays in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, Niobrara, Mississippian, Ohio Utica Shale, and the Michigan Basin.\\n\\nThat year it also closed a similar $1.4 billion joint venture deal with Sumitomo Corp. to develop 650,000 net acres in the Cline Shale and the Midland-Wolfcamp Shale in West Texas.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nIn 2010 it sold most of its remaining international assets to BP for $7 billion. As part of this deal BP sold undeveloped oil sand leases in Canada to Devon Energy for $500 million and formed a joint venture with the company to exploit them. The company also sold its Panyu field, offshore China, to China National Offshore Oil for $515 million.\\n\\nConsolidating its North American assets to just its onshore properties, In 2010 Devon Energy sold its stakes in the Cascade, Jack and St. Malo fields in the Gulf of Mexico (about 200 million barrels of estimated recoverable reserves) to AP Moller-Maersk's oil unit for $1.3 billion. It also sold its remaining Gulf of Mexico shelf assets to Apache for $1 billion. – less\",\n",

       "   'description': \"When it comes to data storage, Western Digital has drive. The company is one of the largest independent makers of hard-disk drives, which record, store, and recall volumes of data. Drives for PCs account for most of Western Digital's sales, although the company also makes devices used in servers, cloud computing data centers, and home entertainment products such as set-top boxes and video game consoles. The company sells to manufacturers and through retailers and distributors. More than 60% of its sales are to OEMs such as  Hewlett-Packard, which is Western Digital's largest customer. The company gets more than half of its sales from the Asia/Pacific region.\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nWestern Digital is structured around two subsidiaries: WD Technologies and Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST). Each subsidiary maintains its own brand and product lines, with separate sales, marketing, operations, and product development teams. The company is looking to offer improved customer experiences for competing and complementary brands, while finding efficiencies in shared services.\\n\\nGeographic Reach\\n\\nThe company is seeing strong growth in Asia (which represents more than 55% of sales) and the US (nearly 20%), with slower growth in the EMEA region (another nearly 20%). Western Digital has manufacturing facilities in the US and across Asia and sales offices worldwide.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nWestern Digital is one of a handful of manufacturers that dominate the hard-disk drive market -- a sector characterized by harsh competition, short product life cycles, and aggressive price cuts. In order to reduce its dependence on drives for PCs, the company has branched into branded consumer media devices, including DVR expanders, portable media drives, and media players that let users play data from external drives on TV. Its WD TV Live Plus media player streams movies (including those offered by Netflix) and Internet video to a digital TV. It is also investing in products for the mobile computing and cloud computing markets.\\n\\nAnother promising market for Western Digital is nearline hard drives, which are more cost effective than traditional hard drives by providing more capacity while requiring lower power. Nearline hard drives are used for stimulated applications, such as video surveillance and medical imaging, and IT infrastructure applications, including scientific computing and Web search engines.\\n\\nMergers & Acquisitions\\n\\nIn 2012 Western Digital bought Hitachi's disk drive business, HGST, for around $4.3 billion in cash and stock. The deal boosts Western Digital's share of the global market to nearly 50%, ahead of rival Seagate Technology which accounts for around 30% of global shipments. Strategically, the deal adds disk drives used with servers -- a large part of both Hitachi and Seagate's businesses -- and gives Western Digital a better foothold in solid-state drives used in tablets and other portable devices. The acquisition also provides Western Digital its first manufacturing foothold in China and the Philippines. With the stock portion of the sale, Hitachi gains a 10% stake in Western Digital and two spots on the board of directors.\\n\\nWestern Digital has long used acquisitions to add new product lines and extend its geographic reach. Over the past several years it bought the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya for about $233 million and entered the market for solid-state drives with the $65 million purchase of SiliconSystems. In a large 2007 acquisition, Western Digital bought disk component maker Komag for $1 billion, which gave it the ability to manufacture the media and substrates used in its drives.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis\\n\\nWestern Digital's sales have fluctuated in recent years as it has dealt with the worldwide economic downturn. However, its acquisition of HGST helped produce strong results for fiscal 2012 (ended June 30). The company's revenues grew 31% that year to $12.5 billion, with HGST contributing more than $3 billion of that. It also saw an improvement in hard drive average selling price from $45 in fiscal 2011 to $62 in fiscal 2012.\\n\\nAlthough Western Digital saw increased R&D and SG&A expenses in 2012, the overall strength of revenues led to a 122% jump in net income (to $1.6 billion). – less\",\n",

       "   'description': 'Xcel Energy has accelerated its energy engine in utility markets across the US. The utility holding company distributes electricity to 3.4 million customers and natural gas to 1.9 million in eight states through four regulated utilities; Colorado and Minnesota account for most of its customers. Its utilities -- Northern States Power (NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin), Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service (in New Mexico and Texas) -- have the combined capacity of more than 17,150 MW of electricity. Xcel owns transmission and distribution lines, as well as natural gas assets. It is also the top wind power provider in the US, with wind farms in Colorado, Minnesota, and Texas.\\n\\nGeographic Reach\\n\\nThe company serves customers in Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin.\\n\\n \\n\\nOperations\\n\\nXcel operates power and gas utilities: Northern States Power, Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service. The holding company has more than 80 generating plants, more than 87,750 miles of transmission lines and about 191,840 miles of distribution lines. It also operates an interstate natural gas pipeline company and a joint venture to develop and lease natural gas pipelines, storage, and compression assets.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis\\n\\nIn 2011 Xcel reported a 3% jump in sales due to an increase in demand caused by a warmer-than-normal summer and a colder-than-normal winter. It was also assisted by a 3.7% increase in the electric segment due to cost recovery of the acquisition of the Rocky Mountain and Blue Spruce natural gas facilities by Public Service Company of Colorado and by natural gas retail rate increases in Minnesota.\\n\\nNet income rose by 11% thanks to higher revenues and lower electric fuel and purchased power costs.\\n\\nHigher rates and increased weather-related demand helped sales in 2010 to rise nearly 7%, going from $9.6 billion to about $10.3 billion. \\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nXcel is an energy company in transition, with long-term plans to move from coal-fired plants to natural gas, and on to alternative fuels such as wind, solar, and biomass to boost its green  power capacity (88,705 MWh by 2015).\\n\\nIn 2012 the company was seeking proposals for renewable resources other than wind or solar as part of its plan to diversify Southwestern Public Service Company  renewable energy portfolio.\\n\\nAs the largest US utility wind energy provider, Xcel controlled some 3,500 MW of wind energy in its portfolio in 2011 and plans to have 7,400 MW by 2020. In 2011 Xcel bought the 200 MW Limon Wind Energy Center, which will have 125 turbines in Lincoln and Elbert counties on Colorado\\'s Front Range east of Denver. The company is also the US\\'s fifth-largest utility solar energy provider and owns the fourth-largest transmission system. In addition, Xcel operates more than 25 hydroelectric power plants in Colorado, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.\\n\\nThe company believes its strategy of making environmentally sound investments is pivotal to its success. Among its 2010 projects were launching its 800-MW coal-fired unit in Colorado, known as Comanche 3, after installing advanced emission-reduction equipment. It also began construction of its CapX2020 project, a joint venture transmission expansion project with 10 other utilities, scheduled for completion by 2020. The project includes a 240-mile transmission line from Minnesota to North Dakota. The company has filed to extend the licensing plants of its two nuclear plants on Prairie Island in Minnesota for 20 years, which it expects to save customers more than $1 billion compared to alternative sources.\\n\\nXcel plans to construct one of the largest biomass generating plants in the Midwest. The facility, proposed for the Bay Front Generating Station in Ashland, Wisconsin, will generate power from burning wood waste in all three operating units by 2014. In 2011 Xcel had 73 MW of biomass generating power in Minnesota and Wisconsin.\\n\\nXcel is also working to develop so-called \"smart grid\" technology, which will provide customers with more reliability and control over their energy use. It has completed the nation\\'s first fully integrated SmartGridCity in Boulder, Colorado.\\n\\nIn 2010 Xcel acquired two gas-fired power plants from Calpine Corporation for $739 million. The two Denver-area plants have a generating capacity of more than 900 MW and were already providing power to Public Service Company of Colorado under a contract agreement.

However, we are entering the most dynamic period of change our industry has ever encountered.\\n\\nAn unprecedented confluence of technology, societal change and public health awareness has created a unique opportunity: the opportunity to make a substantial leap forward in our long-held ambition to provide our consumers with potentially reduced-risk tobacco and nicotine choices.\\n\\nOur acquisition of Reynolds American Inc.

As the primary operating subsidiary of Pacific Mutual Holding Company, Pacific Life offers a wide range of life insurance, asset management, and financial services products, including individual annuities and mutual funds. It also offers a variety of investment products and services for individuals, businesses, and pension plans. Subsidiary Pacific Life & Annuity offers the same mix of life insurance and investment products and services for individuals and businesses in New York. Pacific Life was founded in 1868.\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nPacific Life policyholders are members of parent Pacific Mutual Holding Company, which was created in 1997 following a conversion to the mutual holding company structure. Pacific LifeCorp is the intermediate stock holding company.\\n\\nWhile life insurance is the company's bread and butter, it has brought in other operations for variety. Pacific Life's Aviation Capital Group subsidiary leases commercial jets to 90 airlines in more than 40 countries. It also manages aircraft assets for third parties such as commercial airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and financial institutions. Other subsidiaries include Pacific Asset Management, which provides third-party institutional asset management.\\n\\nSales & Marketing\\n\\nPacific Life's insurance policies are sold through independent distributors and through dealer/broker subsidiary Pacific Select Distributors.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis\\n\\nThe company's growth strategies helped Pacific Life achieve strong results in 2011, with revenues increasing 15% over 2010 to almost 6.7 billion, and net income increasing 29% to $679 million. Its operating income climbed a whopping 40% over 2010 to reach $823 million. The gains achieved were attributed to enhanced service offerings, expanded life insurance, annuity, and mutual fund product offerings, and the two acquisitions made that year.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nBeing a mutual company, Pacific Life operates with a long-term focus to serve in the best interests of its policyholders and clients. in doing so, the company navigated the chilly economic waters of the 2008-2009 recession by steadily introducing new products and building up its capital reserves. By 2010 its net income had grown as risk-weary customers squirreled more of their savings and retirement monies into life insurance and mutual funds.\\n\\nMergers, Acquisitions & Divestitures\\n\\nIn 2008 the company added international reinsurance to its portfolio when it acquired the former London-based specialty reinsurance operations of Scottish Re and renamed the business as Pacific Life Re. It then added life retrocession (reinsurance of a reinsurer) to its line-up in 2011 by acquiring that business from Manulife and expanded its business to include the Toronto, Boston, Barbados, and Cologne markets.\\n\\nAlso in 2011 Pacific life bought JPMorgan Chase's pension risk advisory business to form Pacific Global Advisors. The unit offers risk management solutions and advisory services to pension plan sponsors.\\n\\nThe firm divested a noncore business, College Savings Bank, in 2012 to a syndicate of investors for an undisclosed price. The banking unit managed two state-sponsored 529 college savings plans. – less\",\n",

It also engages in natural gas compressing, treating, processing, transporting, and selling. DCP Midstream LLC also transports and sells NGLs and distributes propane wholesale. The company operates natural gas gathering systems (5,300 miles of pipe) in eight states (including Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas), seven processing plants, four NGL pipelines, and nine propane storage terminals. Spectra Energy holds a 50% holding in DCP (ConocoPhillips holds the other 50%).\\n\\nA consolidator in the fragmented natural gas gathering, NGLs, and wholesale propane industry segments, the company has been expanding its gas supply base and its propane wholesale network in recent years through strategic complementary acquisitions and joint ventures.\\n\\nIn 2012 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Texas-based Crossroads processing plant and gathering system from Penn Virginia Resource Partners for $63 million. The bolt-on acquisition allows the company to expand its market position in East Texas and provide services to drillers in the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley regions.\\n\\nIn 2011 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Seaway Products Pipeline Co. from ConocoPhillips. The pipeline, now called Southern Hills Pipeline and being converted to NGL service, is expected to be operational by mid-2013. It will provide NGL access from the Midcontinent to the Texas Gulf Coast.\\n\\nThe company agreed to form a joint venture with EQT Corporation to develop natural gas processing and related natural gas liquid (NGL) infrastructure in the Marcellus and Huron shale plays in the Appalachian basin. (However, the parties could not come to agreement and dropped the plan in early 2011). In 2010, the company acquired the Liberty gathering system and south Raywood processing plant from Ceritas Energy in southeast Texas. The pipeline system interconnects with DCP Midstream's Centana Intrastate Pipeline system.\\n\\nExpanding in Michigan, in 2009 the company acquired gas gathering and treating assets for $45.1 million. In 2010 it acquired a 350-mile interstate natural gas liquids pipeline system in Colorado's Denver-Julesburg Basin from Buckeye Partners for $22 million.\\n\\nIn 2010 DCP Midstream Partners moved to extend its Northeast wholesale propane business into the MidAtlantic region, acquiring UGI's Atlantic Energy for $49 million. That year it also purchased of NGL storage company Marysville Hydrocarbon Holdings (in Michigan) for about $95 million.\\n\\nAlthough DCP Midstream Partners' revenues suffered in 2009 as a result of the global recession and lower commodity prices, acquisitions and organic growth managed to offset lower natural gas volumes.  Acquisitions, increased demand, higher commodity and propane prices, and gains on derivatives help to lift the company's revenues and net income in 2010.\\n\\nIn terms of the company's origins, the D in DCP Midstream Partners (formerly Duke Energy Field Services) is for Duke Energy; the CP, ConocoPhillips. These two energy majors formed DCP Midstream Partners in 2005. Following the spinoff of Spectra Energy from Duke Energy in 2007, Spectra Energy assumed Duke Energy's 50% holding in DCP. – less\",\n",

       "   'description': \"DCP Midstream Partners is the publicly traded entity of DCP Midstream LLC, one of the largest natural gas gatherers in North America and also the top producer and one of the primary marketers of natural gas liquids (NGLs). It also engages in natural gas compressing, treating, processing, transporting, and selling. DCP Midstream LLC also transports and sells NGLs and distributes propane wholesale. The company operates natural gas gathering systems (5,300 miles of pipe) in eight states (including Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas), seven processing plants, four NGL pipelines, and nine propane storage terminals. Spectra Energy holds a 50% holding in DCP (ConocoPhillips holds the other 50%).\\n\\nA consolidator in the fragmented natural gas gathering, NGLs, and wholesale propane industry segments, the company has been expanding its gas supply base and its propane wholesale network in recent years through strategic complementary acquisitions and joint ventures.\\n\\nIn 2012 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Texas-based Crossroads processing plant and gathering system from Penn Virginia Resource Partners for $63 million. The bolt-on acquisition allows the company to expand its market position in East Texas and provide services to drillers in the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley regions.\\n\\nIn 2011 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Seaway Products Pipeline Co. from ConocoPhillips. The pipeline, now called Southern Hills Pipeline and being converted to NGL service, is expected to be operational by mid-2013. It will provide NGL access from the Midcontinent to the Texas Gulf Coast.\\n\\nThe company agreed to form a joint venture with EQT Corporation to develop natural gas processing and related natural gas liquid (NGL) infrastructure in the Marcellus and Huron shale plays in the Appalachian basin. (However, the parties could not come to agreement and dropped the plan in early 2011). In 2010, the company acquired the Liberty gathering system and south Raywood processing plant from Ceritas Energy in southeast Texas. The pipeline system interconnects with DCP Midstream's Centana Intrastate Pipeline system.\\n\\nExpanding in Michigan, in 2009 the company acquired gas gathering and treating assets for $45.1 million. In 2010 it acquired a 350-mile interstate natural gas liquids pipeline system in Colorado's Denver-Julesburg Basin from Buckeye Partners for $22 million.\\n\\nIn 2010 DCP Midstream Partners moved to extend its Northeast wholesale propane business into the MidAtlantic region, acquiring UGI's Atlantic Energy for $49 million. That year it also purchased of NGL storage company Marysville Hydrocarbon Holdings (in Michigan) for about $95 million.\\n\\nAlthough DCP Midstream Partners' revenues suffered in 2009 as a result of the global recession and lower commodity prices, acquisitions and organic growth managed to offset lower natural gas volumes.  Acquisitions, increased demand, higher commodity and propane prices, and gains on derivatives help to lift the company's revenues and net income in 2010.\\n\\nIn terms of the company's origins, the D in DCP Midstream Partners (formerly Duke Energy Field Services) is for Duke Energy; the CP, ConocoPhillips. These two energy majors formed DCP Midstream Partners in 2005. Following the spinoff of Spectra Energy from Duke Energy in 2007, Spectra Energy assumed Duke Energy's 50% holding in DCP. – less\",\n",

The utility holding company distributes electricity to 3.4 million customers and natural gas to 1.9 million in eight states through four regulated utilities; Colorado and Minnesota account for most of its customers. Its utilities -- Northern States Power (NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin), Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service (in New Mexico and Texas) -- have the combined capacity of more than 17,150 MW of electricity. Xcel owns transmission and distribution lines, as well as natural gas assets. It is also the top wind power provider in the US, with wind farms in Colorado, Minnesota, and Texas.\\n\\nGeographic Reach\\n\\nThe company serves customers in Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin.\\n\\n \\n\\nOperations\\n\\nXcel operates power and gas utilities: Northern States Power, Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service. The holding company has more than 80 generating plants, more than 87,750 miles of transmission lines and about 191,840 miles of distribution lines. It also operates an interstate natural gas pipeline company and a joint venture to develop and lease natural gas pipelines, storage, and compression assets.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis\\n\\nIn 2011 Xcel reported a 3% jump in sales due to an increase in demand caused by a warmer-than-normal summer and a colder-than-normal winter. It was also assisted by a 3.7% increase in the electric segment due to cost recovery of the acquisition of the Rocky Mountain and Blue Spruce natural gas facilities by Public Service Company of Colorado and by natural gas retail rate increases in Minnesota.\\n\\nNet income rose by 11% thanks to higher revenues and lower electric fuel and purchased power costs.\\n\\nHigher rates and increased weather-related demand helped sales in 2010 to rise nearly 7%, going from $9.6 billion to about $10.3 billion. \\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nXcel is an energy company in transition, with long-term plans to move from coal-fired plants to natural gas, and on to alternative fuels such as wind, solar, and biomass to boost its green  power capacity (88,705 MWh by 2015).\\n\\nIn 2012 the company was seeking proposals for renewable resources other than wind or solar as part of its plan to diversify Southwestern Public Service Company  renewable energy portfolio.\\n\\nAs the largest US utility wind energy provider, Xcel controlled some 3,500 MW of wind energy in its portfolio in 2011 and plans to have 7,400 MW by 2020. In 2011 Xcel bought the 200 MW Limon Wind Energy Center, which will have 125 turbines in Lincoln and Elbert counties on Colorado\\'s Front Range east of Denver. The company is also the US\\'s fifth-largest utility solar energy provider and owns the fourth-largest transmission system. In addition, Xcel operates more than 25 hydroelectric power plants in Colorado, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.\\n\\nThe company believes its strategy of making environmentally sound investments is pivotal to its success. Among its 2010 projects were launching its 800-MW coal-fired unit in Colorado, known as Comanche 3, after installing advanced emission-reduction equipment. It also began construction of its CapX2020 project, a joint venture transmission expansion project with 10 other utilities, scheduled for completion by 2020. The project includes a 240-mile transmission line from Minnesota to North Dakota. The company has filed to extend the licensing plants of its two nuclear plants on Prairie Island in Minnesota for 20 years, which it expects to save customers more than $1 billion compared to alternative sources.\\n\\nXcel plans to construct one of the largest biomass generating plants in the Midwest. The facility, proposed for the Bay Front Generating Station in Ashland, Wisconsin, will generate power from burning wood waste in all three operating units by 2014. In 2011 Xcel had 73 MW of biomass generating power in Minnesota and Wisconsin.\\n\\nXcel is also working to develop so-called \"smart grid\" technology, which will provide customers with more reliability and control over their energy use. It has completed the nation\\'s first fully integrated SmartGridCity in Boulder, Colorado.\\n\\nIn 2010 Xcel acquired two gas-fired power plants from Calpine Corporation for $739 million. The two Denver-area plants have a generating capacity of more than 900 MW and were already providing power to Public Service Company of Colorado under a contract agreement. The company is planning to acquire 775 MW of new wind-power capacity for its Colorado system over the next several years. – less',\n",

Ameren has a generating capacity of 16,000 MW (primarily coal-fired), most of which is controlled by utility Union Electric (which does business as Ameren Missouri) and nonregulated subsidiary AmerenEnergy Resources Generating Company. Ameren, which also supplies merchant generation power to third parties, operates a nuclear power facility, three hydroelectric plants, and several coal-fired plants and turbine combustion facilities. It also purchases power, including windpower.\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nIn addition to operating power plants, Ameren procures natural gas for its affiliated companies, builds new power plants, and provides long-term energy supply contracts. It also markets and trades electricity to wholesale and retail customers and provides risk management and other energy-related services.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis\\n\\nAmeren's overall revenues dipped in 2011. While increased rates helped to lift Ameren Missouri's revenues in 2011, Ameren Illinois' regulated segment and the merchant generation segment both reported a drop in revenues. In particular, low gas prices and a warm winter hurt gas revenues. However, lower purchased power and resale gas, coupled with a drop in goodwill, impairment, and other charges, helped to lift Ameren's net income for the year.\\n\\nFavorable weather conditions (which increased energy demand) and rate increases help to lift the company's revenues in 2010. However, impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets in the merchant generation segment (due to the sustained decline in market prices for electricity) dragged down Ameren's operating income.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nIn 2010 the company combined AmerenIP, AmerenCIPS, and AmerenCILCO into one entity, Ameren Illinois, in order to streamline operations and reduce confusion among customers. The three Illinois utilities have operated as a single business since 2004 and deliver energy to more than 1,100 communities. Ameren Illinois also operates some 21,400 miles of natural gas distribution and transmission lines.\\n\\nTo comply with federal requirements to separate ownership of power generation and transmission businesses, the operations of Ameren subsidiaries' transmission assets are under the control ofMidwest Independent Transmission System Operator, a regional transmission organization that coordinates power across 15 Midwestern states and one Canadian Province.  – less\",\n",

Barclays Bank offers standard retail services such as deposit accounts and lending, including Woolwich-brand mortgages. The bank also provides commercial money transfer services, insurance products, the Barclaycard line of credit cards, and financial advisory services. Barclays Bank traces its roots to the late 17th century.\\n\\nBarclays Bank has been building up its portfolio of global credit card accounts, especially as other financial groups sell off noncore units during the economic recovery. In 2010 the company acquired the Italian credit card accounts of Citigroup in a deal that included some 197,000 card accounts and approximately €234 million ($320 million) worth of assets. It previously bought Goldfish, the struggling UK credit card unit of Discover Financial Services, for some £46 million ($70 million). In 2011 Barclays acquired Egg UK's credit card portfolio, which added more than 1 million accounts; it has agreed to buy more Citibank card accounts.\\n\\nThe bank has also been offloading some of its own holdings as part of an overall corporate restructuring. In 2010 Barclays sold its US subprime loan servicing business, HomEq Servicing, to Ocwen Financial. It also announced plans to abandon retail banking in certain international markets and instead focus on wholesale and commercial banking. In 2011 it shuttered its Indonesian retail unit Bank Akita, which it had acquired only two years before. The company also sold its Russian retail and commercial operations to a group of investors, citing difficulties competing in the market. Barclays will instead focus on its investment banking activities in the region.\\n\\nIn 2010 Barclays acquired Standard Life Bank from Standard Life for £226 million ($369 million). The deal added Standard Life's savings and mortgage books to the Barclays fold. Also as part of the deal, Barclays and Standard Life entered into a partnership whereby Barclays markets pension products to its clients.\\n\\nDespite challenges in the economy, especially in regards to Europe's debt problems, Barclays Bank's revenues grew 8% in 2011. Its Africa business performed relatively strongly, with credit impairments improving, as did Barclaycard, thanks to the portfolio acquisitions which delivered profits. That year the bank closed nearly 150 European branches (largely located in Spain), the costs of which contributed to a 5% decline in net income. – less\",\n",

The company's main stomping ground is Texas, where it has regulated power distribution operations through subsidiary CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric. CenterPoint Energy operates more than 48,230 miles of power distribution lines, 8,000 miles of interstate gas pipeline, and 3,800 miles of gas gathering pipeline. It also provides natural gas field services. \\n\\nOperations\\n\\nThe company's natural gas distribution subsidiaries serve customers in Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas. (Texas represented 47% of all natural gas distribution customers in 2010). CenterPoint Energy also markets natural gas and related services to 12,200 commercial, industrial, and wholesale customers located primarily in the eastern US. It also provides HVAC and other energy-related services through its gas division.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis\\n\\nCenterPoint Energy's sales dropped dramatically in 2009 as the global recession prompted a slump in commodity prices which hurt the performance of its different energy segments. A reviving economy in 2010 led to a stronger demand for power and gas (coupled with rate increases and weather-related spikes in consumption) resulting in a overall jump in revenues and net income that year.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nCenterPoint Energy's strategy is focused on enhancing and expanding existing core operations, while acquiring complementary and synergistic businesses. In 2011 the company acquired Denver-based natural gas marketing firm Asgard Energy, which supplies gas to agricultural, commercial, industrial, and residential customers in five states (Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, and West Virginia). The acquisition fit into CenterPoint's strategy to expand into the Rockies and diversify into residential choice markets.\\n\\nIn 2012, to add to its midstream assets, CenterPoint Energy Field Services (CEFS), an indirect subsidiary of the company, acquired gathering and processing assets from Prism Gas Systems, a subsidiary of Martin Midstream Partners for $275 million. The assets include Prism's 50% stake in Texas-based Waskom Gas Processing Co. A CEFS subsidiary owns the other 50% stake in Waskom.  – less\",\n",

The PFG Customized distribution unit serves chain restaurants such as Cracker Barrel and Ruby Tuesday. PFG subsidiary Vistar is a distributor of candy, snacks, and convenience foods for vending operators, retailers, and concessions. The company is owned by The Blackstone Group and Wellspring Capital Management, which took the business private in 2008.\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nWith the $1.3 billion buyout in 2008 PFG was merged with Colorado-based Vistar (which was already controlled by Blackstone) to create a giant in the foodservice distribution industry with tentacles reaching into several markets. The combined business continues to operate under the PFG name, although each unit maintains its own headquarters. Across the company's foodservice, Vistar, and customized distribution businesses PFG collectively delivers more than 98,000 national- and proprietary-branded food and food-related products to more than 128,000 customers. As part of its operations, PFG maintains about 70 distribution centers and more than a dozen Merchant's Mart locations in the US.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nFor PFG's broadline Performance Foodservice division, the focus has been on building the range of products it distributes to existing customers while improving margins. The division's more than 41,000 customers, located in about 40 countries, include franchisees of such chains as Burger King, Popeyes (owned by AFC Enterprises), and Subway. It also serves contract foodservice operators, such as Compass Group North America.\\n\\nMergers and Acquisitions\\n\\nThe company moved to expand its broadline division in mid-2012 by acquiring Carolina-based rival Institution Food House from Alex Lee. It also entered into an agreement in late 2012 to buy independent broadline foodservice distributor Fox River Foods, which serves seven states primarily in the Upper Midwestern region. The deals followed PFG's purchase in 2010 of Ledyard Company, which serves central and northern California. To add breadth to its product offering at its New England and Ohio offices, PFG in 2010 bought out the assets of VME Distributors.

It also offers a variety of investment products and services for individuals, businesses, and pension plans. Subsidiary Pacific Life & Annuity offers the same mix of life insurance and investment products and services for individuals and businesses in New York. Pacific Life was founded in 1868.\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nPacific Life policyholders are members of parent Pacific Mutual Holding Company, which was created in 1997 following a conversion to the mutual holding company structure. Pacific LifeCorp is the intermediate stock holding company.\\n\\nWhile life insurance is the company's bread and butter, it has brought in other operations for variety. Pacific Life's Aviation Capital Group subsidiary leases commercial jets to 90 airlines in more than 40 countries. It also manages aircraft assets for third parties such as commercial airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and financial institutions. Other subsidiaries include Pacific Asset Management, which provides third-party institutional asset management.\\n\\nSales & Marketing\\n\\nPacific Life's insurance policies are sold through independent distributors and through dealer/broker subsidiary Pacific Select Distributors.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis\\n\\nThe company's growth strategies helped Pacific Life achieve strong results in 2011, with revenues increasing 15% over 2010 to almost 6.7 billion, and net income increasing 29% to $679 million. Its operating income climbed a whopping 40% over 2010 to reach $823 million. The gains achieved were attributed to enhanced service offerings, expanded life insurance, annuity, and mutual fund product offerings, and the two acquisitions made that year.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nBeing a mutual company, Pacific Life operates with a long-term focus to serve in the best interests of its policyholders and clients. in doing so, the company navigated the chilly economic waters of the 2008-2009 recession by steadily introducing new products and building up its capital reserves. By 2010 its net income had grown as risk-weary customers squirreled more of their savings and retirement monies into life insurance and mutual funds.\\n\\nMergers, Acquisitions & Divestitures\\n\\nIn 2008 the company added international reinsurance to its portfolio when it acquired the former London-based specialty reinsurance operations of Scottish Re and renamed the business as Pacific Life Re. It then added life retrocession (reinsurance of a reinsurer) to its line-up in 2011 by acquiring that business from Manulife and expanded its business to include the Toronto, Boston, Barbados, and Cologne markets.\\n\\nAlso in 2011 Pacific life bought JPMorgan Chase's pension risk advisory business to form Pacific Global Advisors. The unit offers risk management solutions and advisory services to pension plan sponsors.\\n\\nThe firm divested a noncore business, College Savings Bank, in 2012 to a syndicate of investors for an undisclosed price.

The company's primary operations include the manufacture of building block chemicals like acetic acid and vinyl acetate monomers. Those chemicals are used in everything from inks and paints to agricultural products and chewing gum. Canadian subsidiary Acetex, the majority of whose sales come from Europe, is the world's largest acetyls manufacturer. Other products include acetate tow (in cigarette filters); industrial specialties like ethylene vinyl aceta; and engineered plastics. The bulk of sales come from the US and Germany. \\n\\nOperations\\n\\nCelanese operates through four business segments: Advanced Engineered Materials, Consumer Specialties, Industrial Specialties, and Acetyl Intermediates. The company is one of the world's largest producers of acetyl products, as well as a top global producer of engineered polymers.\\n\\nGeographic Reach\\n\\nIn addition to manufacturing sites in the US, it also has properties, plants, and equipment in Belgium, China, Canada, Germany, Mexico, and Singapore.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis\\n\\nCelanese continued its recovery from the recession of 2008-09 with a 14% increase in revenues in 2011, due primarily to higher volumes and increased sales prices across most of its business segments. The largest gains were in its Industrial Specialties unit (up 18%), Advanced Engineered Materials unit (up 17%), and its Acetyl Intermediates segment (up 15%). Net income grew by 61% in 2011, as increased revenues outpaced a more modest growth in operating expenses.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nCelanese's strategy is to grow the company through expansion into emerging regions, particularly China; to offer innovation through developing new products and applications; increase its productivity through energy reduction, business process improvements, and manufacturing optimization; and boost its portfolio by growing its business through both acquisitions or internal growth.\\n\\nIn 2012 the company teamed up with Indonesia's Pertamina, forming a joint venture to develop fuel ethanol projects in that country.\\n\\nTo grow its emulsion polymers business, in 2011 the company acquired two product lines, Vinac and Flexbond, from Ashland. The acquisition is expected to speed up growth of the company's emulsion polymers operations throughout the Americas -- especially in the adhesives, textiles, coatings, and paper segments.\\n\\nCelanese subsidiary Ticona Engineering Polymers acquired two product lines, Zenite liquid crystal polymer and Thermx polycyclohexylene-dimethylene terephthalate, from DuPont Performance Polymers division in 2010. The units expanded Celanese's offerings in the electrical and electronics application segments of the global polymers market. \\n\\nOwnership\\n\\nIn 2012 Capital Research Global Investors owned about 11% of Celanese, with several other investment firms owning a smaller stakes.\\n\\nCompany Background\\n\\nCelanese Corporation was created in 2004 by the Blackstone Group, which had acquired a majority share in Celanese AG, turned it private, and then flipped it in a 2005 public offering.

       "   'description': \"When it comes to data storage, Western Digital has drive. The company is one of the largest independent makers of hard-disk drives, which record, store, and recall volumes of data. Drives for PCs account for most of Western Digital's sales, although the company also makes devices used in servers, cloud computing data centers, and home entertainment products such as set-top boxes and video game consoles. The company sells to manufacturers and through retailers and distributors. More than 60% of its sales are to OEMs such as  Hewlett-Packard, which is Western Digital's largest customer. The company gets more than half of its sales from the Asia/Pacific region.\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nWestern Digital is structured around two subsidiaries: WD Technologies and Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST). Each subsidiary maintains its own brand and product lines, with separate sales, marketing, operations, and product development teams. The company is looking to offer improved customer experiences for competing and complementary brands, while finding efficiencies in shared services.\\n\\nGeographic Reach\\n\\nThe company is seeing strong growth in Asia (which represents more than 55% of sales) and the US (nearly 20%), with slower growth in the EMEA region (another nearly 20%). Western Digital has manufacturing facilities in the US and across Asia and sales offices worldwide.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nWestern Digital is one of a handful of manufacturers that dominate the hard-disk drive market -- a sector characterized by harsh competition, short product life cycles, and aggressive price cuts. In order to reduce its dependence on drives for PCs, the company has branched into branded consumer media devices, including DVR expanders, portable media drives, and media players that let users play data from external drives on TV. Its WD TV Live Plus media player streams movies (including those offered by Netflix) and Internet video to a digital TV. It is also investing in products for the mobile computing and cloud computing markets.\\n\\nAnother promising market for Western Digital is nearline hard drives, which are more cost effective than traditional hard drives by providing more capacity while requiring lower power. Nearline hard drives are used for stimulated applications, such as video surveillance and medical imaging, and IT infrastructure applications, including scientific computing and Web search engines.\\n\\nMergers & Acquisitions\\n\\nIn 2012 Western Digital bought Hitachi's disk drive business, HGST, for around $4.3 billion in cash and stock. The deal boosts Western Digital's share of the global market to nearly 50%, ahead of rival Seagate Technology which accounts for around 30% of global shipments. Strategically, the deal adds disk drives used with servers -- a large part of both Hitachi and Seagate's businesses -- and gives Western Digital a better foothold in solid-state drives used in tablets and other portable devices. The acquisition also provides Western Digital its first manufacturing foothold in China and the Philippines. With the stock portion of the sale, Hitachi gains a 10% stake in Western Digital and two spots on the board of directors.\\n\\nWestern Digital has long used acquisitions to add new product lines and extend its geographic reach. Over the past several years it bought the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya for about $233 million and entered the market for solid-state drives with the $65 million purchase of SiliconSystems. In a large 2007 acquisition, Western Digital bought disk component maker Komag for $1 billion, which gave it the ability to manufacture the media and substrates used in its drives.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis\\n\\nWestern Digital's sales have fluctuated in recent years as it has dealt with the worldwide economic downturn. However, its acquisition of HGST helped produce strong results for fiscal 2012 (ended June 30). The company's revenues grew 31% that year to $12.5 billion, with HGST contributing more than $3 billion of that. It also saw an improvement in hard drive average selling price from $45 in fiscal 2011 to $62 in fiscal 2012.\\n\\nAlthough Western Digital saw increased R&D and SG&A expenses in 2012, the overall strength of revenues led to a 122% jump in net income (to $1.6 billion). – less\",\n",

Its Ameriprise Bank subsidiary offers deposits and loans. Ameriprise, which has about $630 billion of assets under management, distributes its products primarily through a network of more than 9,700 financial advisors.\\n\\nThe company has been sharpening its focus on its branded adviser network. It sold its Securities America independent broker-dealer subsidiary to Ladenburg Thalmann for some $150 million in 2011. Shortly before the sale of the troubled unit, Ameriprise agreed to pay $160 million to settle claims that Securities America brokers sold securities in fraudulent companies.\\n\\nAmeriprise has been steadily boosting its assets under management and growing its client base (focusing on the affluent and mass affluent with at least $100,000 in investable assets). The company also is focused on geographic areas where those clients are congregated and has closed or consolidated offices in areas with less potential. While Columbia Management covers Ameriprise's main asset management market in the US, the company is increasing its global presence through its Threadneedle brand overseas. Ameriprise plans to grow its asset management operations in Europe, as well as in Australia, the Middle East, and Asia.\\n\\nAmeriprise's strategies have paid off. Volatile financial market conditions, which negatively impacted all of the company's operations, led to a decline in revenue in 2008 and 2009. However, the company returned to success in 2010 and revenues grew by more than 20% that year. Poor economic conditions continued in 2011. However, Ameriprise's operating net revenues climbed that year by about 10%. The boost was due to strong growth in the company's fee-based advisory and asset management businesses.\\n\\nAmeriprise Financial, which was founded in 1894, was spun off from American Express in 2005. – less\",\n",

That’s why we promote from within, work hard and get rewarded for it, and win the right way.\\n\\nOur Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) play a key part in leveraging our differences to support an inclusive culture and provide insight into our diverse customers.

The bank is primarily active in the UK, where it has some 1,700 branches, but also has significant retail and commercial operations in Europe, Africa (it owns more than half of South African bank Absa Group), the Middle East, and the US. Barclays Bank offers standard retail services such as deposit accounts and lending, including Woolwich-brand mortgages. The bank also provides commercial money transfer services, insurance products, the Barclaycard line of credit cards, and financial advisory services. Barclays Bank traces its roots to the late 17th century.\\n\\nBarclays Bank has been building up its portfolio of global credit card accounts, especially as other financial groups sell off noncore units during the economic recovery. In 2010 the company acquired the Italian credit card accounts of Citigroup in a deal that included some 197,000 card accounts and approximately €234 million ($320 million) worth of assets. It previously bought Goldfish, the struggling UK credit card unit of Discover Financial Services, for some £46 million ($70 million). In 2011 Barclays acquired Egg UK's credit card portfolio, which added more than 1 million accounts; it has agreed to buy more Citibank card accounts.\\n\\nThe bank has also been offloading some of its own holdings as part of an overall corporate restructuring. In 2010 Barclays sold its US subprime loan servicing business, HomEq Servicing, to Ocwen Financial. It also announced plans to abandon retail banking in certain international markets and instead focus on wholesale and commercial banking. In 2011 it shuttered its Indonesian retail unit Bank Akita, which it had acquired only two years before. The company also sold its Russian retail and commercial operations to a group of investors, citing difficulties competing in the market. Barclays will instead focus on its investment banking activities in the region.\\n\\nIn 2010 Barclays acquired Standard Life Bank from Standard Life for £226 million ($369 million). The deal added Standard Life's savings and mortgage books to the Barclays fold. Also as part of the deal, Barclays and Standard Life entered into a partnership whereby Barclays markets pension products to its clients.\\n\\nDespite challenges in the economy, especially in regards to Europe's debt problems, Barclays Bank's revenues grew 8% in 2011. Its Africa business performed relatively strongly, with credit impairments improving, as did Barclaycard, thanks to the portfolio acquisitions which delivered profits. That year the bank closed nearly 150 European branches (largely located in Spain), the costs of which contributed to a 5% decline in net income. – less\",\n",

       "   'description': \"Independent oil and gas producer Devon Energy puts its energy into oil and gas fields far from England's southwestern coast, in North America. It focuses on exploration and production assets in Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming, and western Canada. In 2011 Devon Energy reported proved reserves of 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent (58% natural gas) and more than 19,900 net acres of assets. It also drilled almost 2,500 gross wells. Devon Energy produces about 2.5 billion cu. ft. of natural gas a day (more than 3% of all the gas consumed in North America). The company is the largest producer and lease holder in the Barnett Shale (Texas) and is looking to replicate its success there to other unconventional plays.\\n\\nGeographic Reach\\n\\nOnce active in major oil patches worldwide such as Azerbaijan, Brazil, and China, in the mid-2000s the company decided to focus on safer and increasingly productive unconventional onshore exploration opportunities (shales and oil sands) in North America. As a result, Devon Energy has sold all of its international assets.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis\\n\\nDevon Energy posted a major improvement in revenues in 2010, thanks to higher commodity prices and an increase in production. In 2011, buoyed by record level reserves, high oil prices, and an increased demand for oil and gas products, the company posted a further 15% growth in revenues. Net income only rose by 3%, however, as higher operating, depreciation, deletion, and amortization costs and an increase in deferred income tax expense trimmed income growth.\\n\\nBoosting its financial resources, in 2012 Devon Energy secured a commitment from Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration & Production for the Chinese company to invest $2.2 billion in exchange for one-third of Devon's interest in five new joint venture plays in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, Niobrara, Mississippian, Ohio Utica Shale, and the Michigan Basin.\\n\\nThat year it also closed a similar $1.4 billion joint venture deal with Sumitomo Corp. to develop 650,000 net acres in the Cline Shale and the Midland-Wolfcamp Shale in West Texas.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nIn 2010 it sold most of its remaining international assets to BP for $7 billion. As part of this deal BP sold undeveloped oil sand leases in Canada to Devon Energy for $500 million and formed a joint venture with the company to exploit them. The company also sold its Panyu field, offshore China, to China National Offshore Oil for $515 million.\\n\\nConsolidating its North American assets to just its onshore properties, In 2010 Devon Energy sold its stakes in the Cascade, Jack and St. Malo fields in the Gulf of Mexico (about 200 million barrels of estimated recoverable reserves) to AP Moller-Maersk's oil unit for $1.3 billion. It also sold its remaining Gulf of Mexico shelf assets to Apache for $1 billion. – less\",\n",

As the primary operating subsidiary of Pacific Mutual Holding Company, Pacific Life offers a wide range of life insurance, asset management, and financial services products, including individual annuities and mutual funds. It also offers a variety of investment products and services for individuals, businesses, and pension plans. Subsidiary Pacific Life & Annuity offers the same mix of life insurance and investment products and services for individuals and businesses in New York. Pacific Life was founded in 1868.\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nPacific Life policyholders are members of parent Pacific Mutual Holding Company, which was created in 1997 following a conversion to the mutual holding company structure. Pacific LifeCorp is the intermediate stock holding company.\\n\\nWhile life insurance is the company's bread and butter, it has brought in other operations for variety. Pacific Life's Aviation Capital Group subsidiary leases commercial jets to 90 airlines in more than 40 countries. It also manages aircraft assets for third parties such as commercial airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and financial institutions. Other subsidiaries include Pacific Asset Management, which provides third-party institutional asset management.\\n\\nSales & Marketing\\n\\nPacific Life's insurance policies are sold through independent distributors and through dealer/broker subsidiary Pacific Select Distributors.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis\\n\\nThe company's growth strategies helped Pacific Life achieve strong results in 2011, with revenues increasing 15% over 2010 to almost 6.7 billion, and net income increasing 29% to $679 million. Its operating income climbed a whopping 40% over 2010 to reach $823 million. The gains achieved were attributed to enhanced service offerings, expanded life insurance, annuity, and mutual fund product offerings, and the two acquisitions made that year.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nBeing a mutual company, Pacific Life operates with a long-term focus to serve in the best interests of its policyholders and clients. in doing so, the company navigated the chilly economic waters of the 2008-2009 recession by steadily introducing new products and building up its capital reserves. By 2010 its net income had grown as risk-weary customers squirreled more of their savings and retirement monies into life insurance and mutual funds.\\n\\nMergers, Acquisitions & Divestitures\\n\\nIn 2008 the company added international reinsurance to its portfolio when it acquired the former London-based specialty reinsurance operations of Scottish Re and renamed the business as Pacific Life Re. It then added life retrocession (reinsurance of a reinsurer) to its line-up in 2011 by acquiring that business from Manulife and expanded its business to include the Toronto, Boston, Barbados, and Cologne markets.\\n\\nAlso in 2011 Pacific life bought JPMorgan Chase's pension risk advisory business to form Pacific Global Advisors. The unit offers risk management solutions and advisory services to pension plan sponsors.\\n\\nThe firm divested a noncore business, College Savings Bank, in 2012 to a syndicate of investors for an undisclosed price. The banking unit managed two state-sponsored 529 college savings plans. – less\",\n",

As the primary operating subsidiary of Pacific Mutual Holding Company, Pacific Life offers a wide range of life insurance, asset management, and financial services products, including individual annuities and mutual funds. It also offers a variety of investment products and services for individuals, businesses, and pension plans. Subsidiary Pacific Life & Annuity offers the same mix of life insurance and investment products and services for individuals and businesses in New York. Pacific Life was founded in 1868.\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nPacific Life policyholders are members of parent Pacific Mutual Holding Company, which was created in 1997 following a conversion to the mutual holding company structure. Pacific LifeCorp is the intermediate stock holding company.\\n\\nWhile life insurance is the company's bread and butter, it has brought in other operations for variety. Pacific Life's Aviation Capital Group subsidiary leases commercial jets to 90 airlines in more than 40 countries. It also manages aircraft assets for third parties such as commercial airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and financial institutions. Other subsidiaries include Pacific Asset Management, which provides third-party institutional asset management.\\n\\nSales & Marketing\\n\\nPacific Life's insurance policies are sold through independent distributors and through dealer/broker subsidiary Pacific Select Distributors.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis\\n\\nThe company's growth strategies helped Pacific Life achieve strong results in 2011, with revenues increasing 15% over 2010 to almost 6.7 billion, and net income increasing 29% to $679 million. Its operating income climbed a whopping 40% over 2010 to reach $823 million. The gains achieved were attributed to enhanced service offerings, expanded life insurance, annuity, and mutual fund product offerings, and the two acquisitions made that year.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nBeing a mutual company, Pacific Life operates with a long-term focus to serve in the best interests of its policyholders and clients. in doing so, the company navigated the chilly economic waters of the 2008-2009 recession by steadily introducing new products and building up its capital reserves. By 2010 its net income had grown as risk-weary customers squirreled more of their savings and retirement monies into life insurance and mutual funds.\\n\\nMergers, Acquisitions & Divestitures\\n\\nIn 2008 the company added international reinsurance to its portfolio when it acquired the former London-based specialty reinsurance operations of Scottish Re and renamed the business as Pacific Life Re. It then added life retrocession (reinsurance of a reinsurer) to its line-up in 2011 by acquiring that business from Manulife and expanded its business to include the Toronto, Boston, Barbados, and Cologne markets.\\n\\nAlso in 2011 Pacific life bought JPMorgan Chase's pension risk advisory business to form Pacific Global Advisors. The unit offers risk management solutions and advisory services to pension plan sponsors.\\n\\nThe firm divested a noncore business, College Savings Bank, in 2012 to a syndicate of investors for an undisclosed price. The banking unit managed two state-sponsored 529 college savings plans. – less\",\n",

       "   'description': 'Xcel Energy has accelerated its energy engine in utility markets across the US. The utility holding company distributes electricity to 3.4 million customers and natural gas to 1.9 million in eight states through four regulated utilities; Colorado and Minnesota account for most of its customers. Its utilities -- Northern States Power (NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin), Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service (in New Mexico and Texas) -- have the combined capacity of more than 17,150 MW of electricity. Xcel owns transmission and distribution lines, as well as natural gas assets. It is also the top wind power provider in the US, with wind farms in Colorado, Minnesota, and Texas.\\n\\nGeographic Reach\\n\\nThe company serves customers in Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin.\\n\\n \\n\\nOperations\\n\\nXcel operates power and gas utilities: Northern States Power, Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service. The holding company has more than 80 generating plants, more than 87,750 miles of transmission lines and about 191,840 miles of distribution lines. It also operates an interstate natural gas pipeline company and a joint venture to develop and lease natural gas pipelines, storage, and compression assets.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis\\n\\nIn 2011 Xcel reported a 3% jump in sales due to an increase in demand caused by a warmer-than-normal summer and a colder-than-normal winter. It was also assisted by a 3.7% increase in the electric segment due to cost recovery of the acquisition of the Rocky Mountain and Blue Spruce natural gas facilities by Public Service Company of Colorado and by natural gas retail rate increases in Minnesota.\\n\\nNet income rose by 11% thanks to higher revenues and lower electric fuel and purchased power costs.\\n\\nHigher rates and increased weather-related demand helped sales in 2010 to rise nearly 7%, going from $9.6 billion to about $10.3 billion. \\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nXcel is an energy company in transition, with long-term plans to move from coal-fired plants to natural gas, and on to alternative fuels such as wind, solar, and biomass to boost its green  power capacity (88,705 MWh by 2015).\\n\\nIn 2012 the company was seeking proposals for renewable resources other than wind or solar as part of its plan to diversify Southwestern Public Service Company  renewable energy portfolio.\\n\\nAs the largest US utility wind energy provider, Xcel controlled some 3,500 MW of wind energy in its portfolio in 2011 and plans to have 7,400 MW by 2020. In 2011 Xcel bought the 200 MW Limon Wind Energy Center, which will have 125 turbines in Lincoln and Elbert counties on Colorado\\'s Front Range east of Denver. The company is also the US\\'s fifth-largest utility solar energy provider and owns the fourth-largest transmission system. In addition, Xcel operates more than 25 hydroelectric power plants in Colorado, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.\\n\\nThe company believes its strategy of making environmentally sound investments is pivotal to its success. Among its 2010 projects were launching its 800-MW coal-fired unit in Colorado, known as Comanche 3, after installing advanced emission-reduction equipment. It also began construction of its CapX2020 project, a joint venture transmission expansion project with 10 other utilities, scheduled for completion by 2020. The project includes a 240-mile transmission line from Minnesota to North Dakota. The company has filed to extend the licensing plants of its two nuclear plants on Prairie Island in Minnesota for 20 years, which it expects to save customers more than $1 billion compared to alternative sources.\\n\\nXcel plans to construct one of the largest biomass generating plants in the Midwest. The facility, proposed for the Bay Front Generating Station in Ashland, Wisconsin, will generate power from burning wood waste in all three operating units by 2014. In 2011 Xcel had 73 MW of biomass generating power in Minnesota and Wisconsin.\\n\\nXcel is also working to develop so-called \"smart grid\" technology, which will provide customers with more reliability and control over their energy use. It has completed the nation\\'s first fully integrated SmartGridCity in Boulder, Colorado.\\n\\nIn 2010 Xcel acquired two gas-fired power plants from Calpine Corporation for $739 million. The two Denver-area plants have a generating capacity of more than 900 MW and were already providing power to Public Service Company of Colorado under a contract agreement. The company is planning to acquire 775 MW of new wind-power capacity for its Colorado system over the next several years. – less',\n",

       "   'description': \"DCP Midstream Partners is the publicly traded entity of DCP Midstream LLC, one of the largest natural gas gatherers in North America and also the top producer and one of the primary marketers of natural gas liquids (NGLs). It also engages in natural gas compressing, treating, processing, transporting, and selling. DCP Midstream LLC also transports and sells NGLs and distributes propane wholesale. The company operates natural gas gathering systems (5,300 miles of pipe) in eight states (including Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas), seven processing plants, four NGL pipelines, and nine propane storage terminals. Spectra Energy holds a 50% holding in DCP (ConocoPhillips holds the other 50%).\\n\\nA consolidator in the fragmented natural gas gathering, NGLs, and wholesale propane industry segments, the company has been expanding its gas supply base and its propane wholesale network in recent years through strategic complementary acquisitions and joint ventures.\\n\\nIn 2012 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Texas-based Crossroads processing plant and gathering system from Penn Virginia Resource Partners for $63 million. The bolt-on acquisition allows the company to expand its market position in East Texas and provide services to drillers in the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley regions.\\n\\nIn 2011 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Seaway Products Pipeline Co. from ConocoPhillips. The pipeline, now called Southern Hills Pipeline and being converted to NGL service, is expected to be operational by mid-2013. It will provide NGL access from the Midcontinent to the Texas Gulf Coast.\\n\\nThe company agreed to form a joint venture with EQT Corporation to develop natural gas processing and related natural gas liquid (NGL) infrastructure in the Marcellus and Huron shale plays in the Appalachian basin. (However, the parties could not come to agreement and dropped the plan in early 2011). In 2010, the company acquired the Liberty gathering system and south Raywood processing plant from Ceritas Energy in southeast Texas. The pipeline system interconnects with DCP Midstream's Centana Intrastate Pipeline system.\\n\\nExpanding in Michigan, in 2009 the company acquired gas gathering and treating assets for $45.1 million. In 2010 it acquired a 350-mile interstate natural gas liquids pipeline system in Colorado's Denver-Julesburg Basin from Buckeye Partners for $22 million.\\n\\nIn 2010 DCP Midstream Partners moved to extend its Northeast wholesale propane business into the MidAtlantic region, acquiring UGI's Atlantic Energy for $49 million. That year it also purchased of NGL storage company Marysville Hydrocarbon Holdings (in Michigan) for about $95 million.\\n\\nAlthough DCP Midstream Partners' revenues suffered in 2009 as a result of the global recession and lower commodity prices, acquisitions and organic growth managed to offset lower natural gas volumes.  Acquisitions, increased demand, higher commodity and propane prices, and gains on derivatives help to lift the company's revenues and net income in 2010.\\n\\nIn terms of the company's origins, the D in DCP Midstream Partners (formerly Duke Energy Field Services) is for Duke Energy; the CP, ConocoPhillips. These two energy majors formed DCP Midstream Partners in 2005. Following the spinoff of Spectra Energy from Duke Energy in 2007, Spectra Energy assumed Duke Energy's 50% holding in DCP. – less\",\n",

       "   'description': \"DCP Midstream Partners is the publicly traded entity of DCP Midstream LLC, one of the largest natural gas gatherers in North America and also the top producer and one of the primary marketers of natural gas liquids (NGLs). It also engages in natural gas compressing, treating, processing, transporting, and selling. DCP Midstream LLC also transports and sells NGLs and distributes propane wholesale. The company operates natural gas gathering systems (5,300 miles of pipe) in eight states (including Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas), seven processing plants, four NGL pipelines, and nine propane storage terminals. Spectra Energy holds a 50% holding in DCP (ConocoPhillips holds the other 50%).\\n\\nA consolidator in the fragmented natural gas gathering, NGLs, and wholesale propane industry segments, the company has been expanding its gas supply base and its propane wholesale network in recent years through strategic complementary acquisitions and joint ventures.\\n\\nIn 2012 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Texas-based Crossroads processing plant and gathering system from Penn Virginia Resource Partners for $63 million. The bolt-on acquisition allows the company to expand its market position in East Texas and provide services to drillers in the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley regions.\\n\\nIn 2011 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Seaway Products Pipeline Co. from ConocoPhillips. The pipeline, now called Southern Hills Pipeline and being converted to NGL service, is expected to be operational by mid-2013. It will provide NGL access from the Midcontinent to the Texas Gulf Coast.\\n\\nThe company agreed to form a joint venture with EQT Corporation to develop natural gas processing and related natural gas liquid (NGL) infrastructure in the Marcellus and Huron shale plays in the Appalachian basin. (However, the parties could not come to agreement and dropped the plan in early 2011). In 2010, the company acquired the Liberty gathering system and south Raywood processing plant from Ceritas Energy in southeast Texas. The pipeline system interconnects with DCP Midstream's Centana Intrastate Pipeline system.\\n\\nExpanding in Michigan, in 2009 the company acquired gas gathering and treating assets for $45.1 million. In 2010 it acquired a 350-mile interstate natural gas liquids pipeline system in Colorado's Denver-Julesburg Basin from Buckeye Partners for $22 million.\\n\\nIn 2010 DCP Midstream Partners moved to extend its Northeast wholesale propane business into the MidAtlantic region, acquiring UGI's Atlantic Energy for $49 million. That year it also purchased of NGL storage company Marysville Hydrocarbon Holdings (in Michigan) for about $95 million.\\n\\nAlthough DCP Midstream Partners' revenues suffered in 2009 as a result of the global recession and lower commodity prices, acquisitions and organic growth managed to offset lower natural gas volumes.  Acquisitions, increased demand, higher commodity and propane prices, and gains on derivatives help to lift the company's revenues and net income in 2010.\\n\\nIn terms of the company's origins, the D in DCP Midstream Partners (formerly Duke Energy Field Services) is for Duke Energy; the CP, ConocoPhillips. These two energy majors formed DCP Midstream Partners in 2005. Following the spinoff of Spectra Energy from Duke Energy in 2007, Spectra Energy assumed Duke Energy's 50% holding in DCP. – less\",\n",

It focuses on exploration and production assets in Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming, and western Canada. In 2011 Devon Energy reported proved reserves of 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent (58% natural gas) and more than 19,900 net acres of assets. It also drilled almost 2,500 gross wells.

Net income only rose by 3%, however, as higher operating, depreciation, deletion, and amortization costs and an increase in deferred income tax expense trimmed income growth.\\n\\nBoosting its financial resources, in 2012 Devon Energy secured a commitment from Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration & Production for the Chinese company to invest $2.2 billion in exchange for one-third of Devon's interest in five new joint venture plays in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, Niobrara, Mississippian, Ohio Utica Shale, and the Michigan Basin.\\n\\nThat year it also closed a similar $1.4 billion joint venture deal with Sumitomo Corp. to develop 650,000 net acres in the Cline Shale and the Midland-Wolfcamp Shale in West Texas.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nIn 2010 it sold most of its remaining international assets to BP for $7 billion. As part of this deal BP sold undeveloped oil sand leases in Canada to Devon Energy for $500 million and formed a joint venture with the company to exploit them. The company also sold its Panyu field, offshore China, to China National Offshore Oil for $515 million.\\n\\nConsolidating its North American assets to just its onshore properties, In 2010 Devon Energy sold its stakes in the Cascade, Jack and St. Malo fields in the Gulf of Mexico (about 200 million barrels of estimated recoverable reserves) to AP Moller-Maersk's oil unit for $1.3 billion. It also sold its remaining Gulf of Mexico shelf assets to Apache for $1 billion. – less\",\n",

Through its Foodservice division, PFG supplies more than 68,000 products to independent restaurants, hotels, other hospitality operators, and healthcare facilities through some 20 distribution facilities. The PFG Customized distribution unit serves chain restaurants such as Cracker Barrel and Ruby Tuesday. PFG subsidiary Vistar is a distributor of candy, snacks, and convenience foods for vending operators, retailers, and concessions. The company is owned by The Blackstone Group and Wellspring Capital Management, which took the business private in 2008.\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nWith the $1.3 billion buyout in 2008 PFG was merged with Colorado-based Vistar (which was already controlled by Blackstone) to create a giant in the foodservice distribution industry with tentacles reaching into several markets. The combined business continues to operate under the PFG name, although each unit maintains its own headquarters. Across the company's foodservice, Vistar, and customized distribution businesses PFG collectively delivers more than 98,000 national- and proprietary-branded food and food-related products to more than 128,000 customers. As part of its operations, PFG maintains about 70 distribution centers and more than a dozen Merchant's Mart locations in the US.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nFor PFG's broadline Performance Foodservice division, the focus has been on building the range of products it distributes to existing customers while improving margins. The division's more than 41,000 customers, located in about 40 countries, include franchisees of such chains as Burger King, Popeyes (owned by AFC Enterprises), and Subway. It also serves contract foodservice operators, such as Compass Group North America.\\n\\nMergers and Acquisitions\\n\\nThe company moved to expand its broadline division in mid-2012 by acquiring Carolina-based rival Institution Food House from Alex Lee. It also entered into an agreement in late 2012 to buy independent broadline foodservice distributor Fox River Foods, which serves seven states primarily in the Upper Midwestern region. The deals followed PFG's purchase in 2010 of Ledyard Company, which serves central and northern California. To add breadth to its product offering at its New England and Ohio offices, PFG in 2010 bought out the assets of VME Distributors. The wholesale supplier catered to mobile caterers, office coffee services, schools, prisons, and vending operators that do business in New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. – less\",\n",

The company is one of the largest independent makers of hard-disk drives, which record, store, and recall volumes of data. Drives for PCs account for most of Western Digital's sales, although the company also makes devices used in servers, cloud computing data centers, and home entertainment products such as set-top boxes and video game consoles. The company sells to manufacturers and through retailers and distributors. More than 60% of its sales are to OEMs such as  Hewlett-Packard, which is Western Digital's largest customer. The company gets more than half of its sales from the Asia/Pacific region.\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nWestern Digital is structured around two subsidiaries: WD Technologies and Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST). Each subsidiary maintains its own brand and product lines, with separate sales, marketing, operations, and product development teams. The company is looking to offer improved customer experiences for competing and complementary brands, while finding efficiencies in shared services.\\n\\nGeographic Reach\\n\\nThe company is seeing strong growth in Asia (which represents more than 55% of sales) and the US (nearly 20%), with slower growth in the EMEA region (another nearly 20%). Western Digital has manufacturing facilities in the US and across Asia and sales offices worldwide.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nWestern Digital is one of a handful of manufacturers that dominate the hard-disk drive market -- a sector characterized by harsh competition, short product life cycles, and aggressive price cuts. In order to reduce its dependence on drives for PCs, the company has branched into branded consumer media devices, including DVR expanders, portable media drives, and media players that let users play data from external drives on TV. Its WD TV Live Plus media player streams movies (including those offered by Netflix) and Internet video to a digital TV. It is also investing in products for the mobile computing and cloud computing markets.\\n\\nAnother promising market for Western Digital is nearline hard drives, which are more cost effective than traditional hard drives by providing more capacity while requiring lower power. Nearline hard drives are used for stimulated applications, such as video surveillance and medical imaging, and IT infrastructure applications, including scientific computing and Web search engines.\\n\\nMergers & Acquisitions\\n\\nIn 2012 Western Digital bought Hitachi's disk drive business, HGST, for around $4.3 billion in cash and stock. The deal boosts Western Digital's share of the global market to nearly 50%, ahead of rival Seagate Technology which accounts for around 30% of global shipments. Strategically, the deal adds disk drives used with servers -- a large part of both Hitachi and Seagate's businesses -- and gives Western Digital a better foothold in solid-state drives used in tablets and other portable devices. The acquisition also provides Western Digital its first manufacturing foothold in China and the Philippines. With the stock portion of the sale, Hitachi gains a 10% stake in Western Digital and two spots on the board of directors.\\n\\nWestern Digital has long used acquisitions to add new product lines and extend its geographic reach. Over the past several years it bought the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya for about $233 million and entered the market for solid-state drives with the $65 million purchase of SiliconSystems. In a large 2007 acquisition, Western Digital bought disk component maker Komag for $1 billion, which gave it the ability to manufacture the media and substrates used in its drives.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis\\n\\nWestern Digital's sales have fluctuated in recent years as it has dealt with the worldwide economic downturn. However, its acquisition of HGST helped produce strong results for fiscal 2012 (ended June 30). The company's revenues grew 31% that year to $12.5 billion, with HGST contributing more than $3 billion of that. It also saw an improvement in hard drive average selling price from $45 in fiscal 2011 to $62 in fiscal 2012.\\n\\nAlthough Western Digital saw increased R&D and SG&A expenses in 2012, the overall strength of revenues led to a 122% jump in net income (to $1.6 billion). – less\",\n",

The holding company distributes electricity to 2.4 million customers and natural gas to 900,000 customers in Missouri and Illinois through utility subsidiaries. Ameren has a generating capacity of 16,000 MW (primarily coal-fired), most of which is controlled by utility Union Electric (which does business as Ameren Missouri) and nonregulated subsidiary AmerenEnergy Resources Generating Company. Ameren, which also supplies merchant generation power to third parties, operates a nuclear power facility, three hydroelectric plants, and several coal-fired plants and turbine combustion facilities. It also purchases power, including windpower.\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nIn addition to operating power plants, Ameren procures natural gas for its affiliated companies, builds new power plants, and provides long-term energy supply contracts. It also markets and trades electricity to wholesale and retail customers and provides risk management and other energy-related services.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis\\n\\nAmeren's overall revenues dipped in 2011. While increased rates helped to lift Ameren Missouri's revenues in 2011, Ameren Illinois' regulated segment and the merchant generation segment both reported a drop in revenues. In particular, low gas prices and a warm winter hurt gas revenues. However, lower purchased power and resale gas, coupled with a drop in goodwill, impairment, and other charges, helped to lift Ameren's net income for the year.\\n\\nFavorable weather conditions (which increased energy demand) and rate increases help to lift the company's revenues in 2010. However, impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets in the merchant generation segment (due to the sustained decline in market prices for electricity) dragged down Ameren's operating income.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nIn 2010 the company combined AmerenIP, AmerenCIPS, and AmerenCILCO into one entity, Ameren Illinois, in order to streamline operations and reduce confusion among customers. The three Illinois utilities have operated as a single business since 2004 and deliver energy to more than 1,100 communities. Ameren Illinois also operates some 21,400 miles of natural gas distribution and transmission lines.\\n\\nTo comply with federal requirements to separate ownership of power generation and transmission businesses, the operations of Ameren subsidiaries' transmission assets are under the control ofMidwest Independent Transmission System Operator, a regional transmission organization that coordinates power across 15 Midwestern states and one Canadian Province.  – less\",\n",

The bank is primarily active in the UK, where it has some 1,700 branches, but also has significant retail and commercial operations in Europe, Africa (it owns more than half of South African bank Absa Group), the Middle East, and the US. Barclays Bank offers standard retail services such as deposit accounts and lending, including Woolwich-brand mortgages. The bank also provides commercial money transfer services, insurance products, the Barclaycard line of credit cards, and financial advisory services. Barclays Bank traces its roots to the late 17th century.\\n\\nBarclays Bank has been building up its portfolio of global credit card accounts, especially as other financial groups sell off noncore units during the economic recovery. In 2010 the company acquired the Italian credit card accounts of Citigroup in a deal that included some 197,000 card accounts and approximately €234 million ($320 million) worth of assets. It previously bought Goldfish, the struggling UK credit card unit of Discover Financial Services, for some £46 million ($70 million). In 2011 Barclays acquired Egg UK's credit card portfolio, which added more than 1 million accounts; it has agreed to buy more Citibank card accounts.\\n\\nThe bank has also been offloading some of its own holdings as part of an overall corporate restructuring. In 2010 Barclays sold its US subprime loan servicing business, HomEq Servicing, to Ocwen Financial. It also announced plans to abandon retail banking in certain international markets and instead focus on wholesale and commercial banking. In 2011 it shuttered its Indonesian retail unit Bank Akita, which it had acquired only two years before. The company also sold its Russian retail and commercial operations to a group of investors, citing difficulties competing in the market. Barclays will instead focus on its investment banking activities in the region.\\n\\nIn 2010 Barclays acquired Standard Life Bank from Standard Life for £226 million ($369 million). The deal added Standard Life's savings and mortgage books to the Barclays fold. Also as part of the deal, Barclays and Standard Life entered into a partnership whereby Barclays markets pension products to its clients.\\n\\nDespite challenges in the economy, especially in regards to Europe's debt problems, Barclays Bank's revenues grew 8% in 2011. Its Africa business performed relatively strongly, with credit impairments improving, as did Barclaycard, thanks to the portfolio acquisitions which delivered profits. That year the bank closed nearly 150 European branches (largely located in Spain), the costs of which contributed to a 5% decline in net income. – less\",\n",

It also offers a variety of investment products and services for individuals, businesses, and pension plans. Subsidiary Pacific Life & Annuity offers the same mix of life insurance and investment products and services for individuals and businesses in New York. Pacific Life was founded in 1868.\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nPacific Life policyholders are members of parent Pacific Mutual Holding Company, which was created in 1997 following a conversion to the mutual holding company structure. Pacific LifeCorp is the intermediate stock holding company.\\n\\nWhile life insurance is the company's bread and butter, it has brought in other operations for variety. Pacific Life's Aviation Capital Group subsidiary leases commercial jets to 90 airlines in more than 40 countries.

Other subsidiaries include Pacific Asset Management, which provides third-party institutional asset management.\\n\\nSales & Marketing\\n\\nPacific Life's insurance policies are sold through independent distributors and through dealer/broker subsidiary Pacific Select Distributors.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis\\n\\nThe company's growth strategies helped Pacific Life achieve strong results in 2011, with revenues increasing 15% over 2010 to almost 6.7 billion, and net income increasing 29% to $679 million. Its operating income climbed a whopping 40% over 2010 to reach $823 million. The gains achieved were attributed to enhanced service offerings, expanded life insurance, annuity, and mutual fund product offerings, and the two acquisitions made that year.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nBeing a mutual company, Pacific Life operates with a long-term focus to serve in the best interests of its policyholders and clients. in doing so, the company navigated the chilly economic waters of the 2008-2009 recession by steadily introducing new products and building up its capital reserves. By 2010 its net income had grown as risk-weary customers squirreled more of their savings and retirement monies into life insurance and mutual funds.\\n\\nMergers, Acquisitions & Divestitures\\n\\nIn 2008 the company added international reinsurance to its portfolio when it acquired the former London-based specialty reinsurance operations of Scottish Re and renamed the business as Pacific Life Re. It then added life retrocession (reinsurance of a reinsurer) to its line-up in 2011 by acquiring that business from Manulife and expanded its business to include the Toronto, Boston, Barbados, and Cologne markets.\\n\\nAlso in 2011 Pacific life bought JPMorgan Chase's pension risk advisory business to form Pacific Global Advisors. The unit offers risk management solutions and advisory services to pension plan sponsors.\\n\\nThe firm divested a noncore business, College Savings Bank, in 2012 to a syndicate of investors for an undisclosed price.

       "   'description': \"Ameren provides the power that makes much of the American Midwest run. The holding company distributes electricity to 2.4 million customers and natural gas to 900,000 customers in Missouri and Illinois through utility subsidiaries. Ameren has a generating capacity of 16,000 MW (primarily coal-fired), most of which is controlled by utility Union Electric (which does business as Ameren Missouri) and nonregulated subsidiary AmerenEnergy Resources Generating Company. Ameren, which also supplies merchant generation power to third parties, operates a nuclear power facility, three hydroelectric plants, and several coal-fired plants and turbine combustion facilities. It also purchases power, including windpower.\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nIn addition to operating power plants, Ameren procures natural gas for its affiliated companies, builds new power plants, and provides long-term energy supply contracts. It also markets and trades electricity to wholesale and retail customers and provides risk management and other energy-related services.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis\\n\\nAmeren's overall revenues dipped in 2011. While increased rates helped to lift Ameren Missouri's revenues in 2011, Ameren Illinois' regulated segment and the merchant generation segment both reported a drop in revenues. In particular, low gas prices and a warm winter hurt gas revenues. However, lower purchased power and resale gas, coupled with a drop in goodwill, impairment, and other charges, helped to lift Ameren's net income for the year.\\n\\nFavorable weather conditions (which increased energy demand) and rate increases help to lift the company's revenues in 2010.

The PFG Customized distribution unit serves chain restaurants such as Cracker Barrel and Ruby Tuesday.

The company is owned by The Blackstone Group and Wellspring Capital Management, which took the business private in 2008.\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nWith the $1.3 billion buyout in 2008 PFG was merged with Colorado-based Vistar (which was already controlled by Blackstone) to create a giant in the foodservice distribution industry with tentacles reaching into several markets. The combined business continues to operate under the PFG name, although each unit maintains its own headquarters. Across the company's foodservice, Vistar, and customized distribution businesses PFG collectively delivers more than 98,000 national- and proprietary-branded food and food-related products to more than 128,000 customers. As part of its operations, PFG maintains about 70 distribution centers and more than a dozen Merchant's Mart locations in the US.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nFor PFG's broadline Performance Foodservice division, the focus has been on building the range of products it distributes to existing customers while improving margins. The division's more than 41,000 customers, located in about 40 countries, include franchisees of such chains as Burger King, Popeyes (owned by AFC Enterprises), and Subway. It also serves contract foodservice operators, such as Compass Group North America.\\n\\nMergers and Acquisitions\\n\\nThe company moved to expand its broadline division in mid-2012 by acquiring Carolina-based rival Institution Food House from Alex Lee. It also entered into an agreement in late 2012 to buy independent broadline foodservice distributor Fox River Foods, which serves seven states primarily in the Upper Midwestern region. The deals followed PFG's purchase in 2010 of Ledyard Company, which serves central and northern California. To add breadth to its product offering at its New England and Ohio offices, PFG in 2010 bought out the assets of VME Distributors.

The PFG Customized distribution unit serves chain restaurants such as Cracker Barrel and Ruby Tuesday. PFG subsidiary Vistar is a distributor of candy, snacks, and convenience foods for vending operators, retailers, and concessions. The company is owned by The Blackstone Group and Wellspring Capital Management, which took the business private in 2008.\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nWith the $1.3 billion buyout in 2008 PFG was merged with Colorado-based Vistar (which was already controlled by Blackstone) to create a giant in the foodservice distribution industry with tentacles reaching into several markets. The combined business continues to operate under the PFG name, although each unit maintains its own headquarters. Across the company's foodservice, Vistar, and customized distribution businesses PFG collectively delivers more than 98,000 national- and proprietary-branded food and food-related products to more than 128,000 customers. As part of its operations, PFG maintains about 70 distribution centers and more than a dozen Merchant's Mart locations in the US.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nFor PFG's broadline Performance Foodservice division, the focus has been on building the range of products it distributes to existing customers while improving margins. The division's more than 41,000 customers, located in about 40 countries, include franchisees of such chains as Burger King, Popeyes (owned by AFC Enterprises), and Subway. It also serves contract foodservice operators, such as Compass Group North America.\\n\\nMergers and Acquisitions\\n\\nThe company moved to expand its broadline division in mid-2012 by acquiring Carolina-based rival Institution Food House from Alex Lee. It also entered into an agreement in late 2012 to buy independent broadline foodservice distributor Fox River Foods, which serves seven states primarily in the Upper Midwestern region. The deals followed PFG's purchase in 2010 of Ledyard Company, which serves central and northern California. To add breadth to its product offering at its New England and Ohio offices, PFG in 2010 bought out the assets of VME Distributors. The wholesale supplier catered to mobile caterers, office coffee services, schools, prisons, and vending operators that do business in New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. – less\",\n",

Other products include acetate tow (in cigarette filters); industrial specialties like ethylene vinyl aceta; and engineered plastics. The bulk of sales come from the US and Germany. \\n\\nOperations\\n\\nCelanese operates through four business segments: Advanced Engineered Materials, Consumer Specialties, Industrial Specialties, and Acetyl Intermediates. The company is one of the world's largest producers of acetyl products, as well as a top global producer of engineered polymers.\\n\\nGeographic Reach\\n\\nIn addition to manufacturing sites in the US, it also has properties, plants, and equipment in Belgium, China, Canada, Germany, Mexico, and Singapore.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis\\n\\nCelanese continued its recovery from the recession of 2008-09 with a 14% increase in revenues in 2011, due primarily to higher volumes and increased sales prices across most of its business segments. The largest gains were in its Industrial Specialties unit (up 18%), Advanced Engineered Materials unit (up 17%), and its Acetyl Intermediates segment (up 15%). Net income grew by 61% in 2011, as increased revenues outpaced a more modest growth in operating expenses.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nCelanese's strategy is to grow the company through expansion into emerging regions, particularly China; to offer innovation through developing new products and applications; increase its productivity through energy reduction, business process improvements, and manufacturing optimization; and boost its portfolio by growing its business through both acquisitions or internal growth.\\n\\nIn 2012 the company teamed up with Indonesia's Pertamina, forming a joint venture to develop fuel ethanol projects in that country.\\n\\nTo grow its emulsion polymers business, in 2011 the company acquired two product lines, Vinac and Flexbond, from Ashland. The acquisition is expected to speed up growth of the company's emulsion polymers operations throughout the Americas -- especially in the adhesives, textiles, coatings, and paper segments.\\n\\nCelanese subsidiary Ticona Engineering Polymers acquired two product lines, Zenite liquid crystal polymer and Thermx polycyclohexylene-dimethylene terephthalate, from DuPont Performance Polymers division in 2010. The units expanded Celanese's offerings in the electrical and electronics application segments of the global polymers market. \\n\\nOwnership\\n\\nIn 2012 Capital Research Global Investors owned about 11% of Celanese, with several other investment firms owning a smaller stakes.\\n\\nCompany Background\\n\\nCelanese Corporation was created in 2004 by the Blackstone Group, which had acquired a majority share in Celanese AG, turned it private, and then flipped it in a 2005 public offering.

Barclays Bank offers standard retail services such as deposit accounts and lending, including Woolwich-brand mortgages. The bank also provides commercial money transfer services, insurance products, the Barclaycard line of credit cards, and financial advisory services. Barclays Bank traces its roots to the late 17th century.\\n\\nBarclays Bank has been building up its portfolio of global credit card accounts, especially as other financial groups sell off noncore units during the economic recovery. In 2010 the company acquired the Italian credit card accounts of Citigroup in a deal that included some 197,000 card accounts and approximately €234 million ($320 million) worth of assets. It previously bought Goldfish, the struggling UK credit card unit of Discover Financial Services, for some £46 million ($70 million). In 2011 Barclays acquired Egg UK's credit card portfolio, which added more than 1 million accounts; it has agreed to buy more Citibank card accounts.\\n\\nThe bank has also been offloading some of its own holdings as part of an overall corporate restructuring. In 2010 Barclays sold its US subprime loan servicing business, HomEq Servicing, to Ocwen Financial. It also announced plans to abandon retail banking in certain international markets and instead focus on wholesale and commercial banking. In 2011 it shuttered its Indonesian retail unit Bank Akita, which it had acquired only two years before. The company also sold its Russian retail and commercial operations to a group of investors, citing difficulties competing in the market. Barclays will instead focus on its investment banking activities in the region.\\n\\nIn 2010 Barclays acquired Standard Life Bank from Standard Life for £226 million ($369 million). The deal added Standard Life's savings and mortgage books to the Barclays fold. Also as part of the deal, Barclays and Standard Life entered into a partnership whereby Barclays markets pension products to its clients.\\n\\nDespite challenges in the economy, especially in regards to Europe's debt problems, Barclays Bank's revenues grew 8% in 2011. Its Africa business performed relatively strongly, with credit impairments improving, as did Barclaycard, thanks to the portfolio acquisitions which delivered profits. That year the bank closed nearly 150 European branches (largely located in Spain), the costs of which contributed to a 5% decline in net income. – less\",\n",

       "   'description': 'Dover Corp. operates in four primary sectors: Fluids, Engineered Systems, Refrigeration and Food Equipment and Energy. It was founded in 1955 as a conglomerate of four manufacturing companies that had been purchased in the 1930s and 1940s by stockbroker George Ohrstrom Sr. The companies made piston rings and seals, auto lifts, oil-well rods and space heaters. From its founding until 1979, Dover bought 14 companies, largely to build the company\\'s elevator business. It was one of the leading elevator companies in the United States until selling that business in 1998. In more recent years, Dover Corp. has experienced rapid growth, purchasing nearly 100 companies in a 15-year span.\\n\\nDover Corp. offers its employees comprehensive healthcare coverage as well as a generous 401(k) contribution match. The company recently launched a comprehensive wellness campaign at each of its sites, which highlights its commitment to employee health. Employees are pleased with Dover\\'s \"strong culture and operating discipline\" and its employees who \"want to make a positive difference\" in the company. Some indicate that there is a \"tremendous work ethic\" at Dover Corp., though others mention the learning platform for new employees \"needs work.\" – less',\n",
