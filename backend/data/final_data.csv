It also engages in natural gas compressing, treating, processing, transporting, and selling. DCP Midstream LLC also transports and sells NGLs and distributes propane wholesale. The company operates natural gas gathering systems (5,300 miles of pipe) in eight states (including Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas), seven processing plants, four NGL pipelines, and nine propane storage terminals. Spectra Energy holds a 50% holding in DCP (ConocoPhillips holds the other 50%).

A consolidator in the fragmented natural gas gathering, NGLs, and wholesale propane industry segments, the company has been expanding its gas supply base and its propane wholesale network in recent years through strategic complementary acquisitions and joint ventures.

In 2012 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Texas-based Crossroads processing plant and gathering system from Penn Virginia Resource Partners for $63 million. The bolt-on acquisition allows the company to expand its market position in East Texas and provide services to drillers in the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley regions.

In 2011 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Seaway Products Pipeline Co. from ConocoPhillips. The pipeline, now called Southern Hills Pipeline and being converted to NGL service, is expected to be operational by mid-2013. It will provide NGL access from the Midcontinent to the Texas Gulf Coast.

The company agreed to form a joint venture with EQT Corporation to develop natural gas processing and related natural gas liquid (NGL) infrastructure in the Marcellus and Huron shale plays in the Appalachian basin. (However, the parties could not come to agreement and dropped the plan in early 2011). In 2010, the company acquired the Liberty gathering system and south Raywood processing plant from Ceritas Energy in southeast Texas. The pipeline system interconnects with DCP Midstream's Centana Intrastate Pipeline system.

Expanding in Michigan, in 2009 the company acquired gas gathering and treating assets for $45.1 million. In 2010 it acquired a 350-mile interstate natural gas liquids pipeline system in Colorado's Denver-Julesburg Basin from Buckeye Partners for $22 million.

In 2010 DCP Midstream Partners moved to extend its Northeast wholesale propane business into the MidAtlantic region, acquiring UGI's Atlantic Energy for $49 million. That year it also purchased of NGL storage company Marysville Hydrocarbon Holdings (in Michigan) for about $95 million.

Although DCP Midstream Partners' revenues suffered in 2009 as a result of the global recession and lower commodity prices, acquisitions and organic growth managed to offset lower natural gas volumes.  Acquisitions, increased demand, higher commodity and propane prices, and gains on derivatives help to lift the company's revenues and net income in 2010.

In terms of the company's origins, the D in DCP Midstream Partners (formerly Duke Energy Field Services) is for Duke Energy; the CP, ConocoPhillips. These two energy majors formed DCP Midstream Partners in 2005. Following the spinoff of Spectra Energy from Duke Energy in 2007, Spectra Energy assumed Duke Energy's 50% holding in DCP. – less",Executive Assistant,$63K-$129K,"Calendar management Travel coordination Meeting scheduling Correspondence and communication Office organization Confidentiality Time management Problem-solving Attention to detail Communication skills Technology proficiency (e.g., MS Office)",Aruba,26239,Oranjestad

Its Ameriprise Bank subsidiary offers deposits and loans. Ameriprise, which has about $630 billion of assets under management, distributes its products primarily through a network of more than 9,700 financial advisors.

The company has been sharpening its focus on its branded adviser network. It sold its Securities America independent broker-dealer subsidiary to Ladenburg Thalmann for some $150 million in 2011. Shortly before the sale of the troubled unit, Ameriprise agreed to pay $160 million to settle claims that Securities America brokers sold securities in fraudulent companies.

Ameriprise has been steadily boosting its assets under management and growing its client base (focusing on the affluent and mass affluent with at least $100,000 in investable assets). The company also is focused on geographic areas where those clients are congregated and has closed or consolidated offices in areas with less potential. While Columbia Management covers Ameriprise's main asset management market in the US, the company is increasing its global presence through its Threadneedle brand overseas. Ameriprise plans to grow its asset management operations in Europe, as well as in Australia, the Middle East, and Asia.

Ameriprise's strategies have paid off. Volatile financial market conditions, which negatively impacted all of the company's operations, led to a decline in revenue in 2008 and 2009. However, the company returned to success in 2010 and revenues grew by more than 20% that year. Poor economic conditions continued in 2011. However, Ameriprise's operating net revenues climbed that year by about 10%. The boost was due to strong growth in the company's fee-based advisory and asset management businesses.

Celanese continued its recovery from the recession of 2008-09 with a 14% increase in revenues in 2011, due primarily to higher volumes and increased sales prices across most of its business segments. The largest gains were in its Industrial Specialties unit (up 18%), Advanced Engineered Materials unit (up 17%), and its Acetyl Intermediates segment (up 15%). Net income grew by 61% in 2011, as increased revenues outpaced a more modest growth in operating expenses.

Strategy

Celanese's strategy is to grow the company through expansion into emerging regions, particularly China; to offer innovation through developing new products and applications; increase its productivity through energy reduction, business process improvements, and manufacturing optimization; and boost its portfolio by growing its business through both acquisitions or internal growth.

In 2012 the company teamed up with Indonesia's Pertamina, forming a joint venture to develop fuel ethanol projects in that country.

To grow its emulsion polymers business, in 2011 the company acquired two product lines, Vinac and Flexbond, from Ashland. The acquisition is expected to speed up growth of the company's emulsion polymers operations throughout the Americas -- especially in the adhesives, textiles, coatings, and paper segments.

Celanese subsidiary Ticona Engineering Polymers acquired two product lines, Zenite liquid crystal polymer and Thermx polycyclohexylene-dimethylene terephthalate, from DuPont Performance Polymers division in 2010. The units expanded Celanese's offerings in the electrical and electronics application segments of the global polymers market. 

Ownership

In 2012 Capital Research Global Investors owned about 11% of Celanese, with several other investment firms owning a smaller stakes.

Company Background

Celanese Corporation was created in 2004 by the Blackstone Group, which had acquired a majority share in Celanese AG, turned it private, and then flipped it in a 2005 public offering. Blackstone finally divested its remaining holdings in Celanese in 2007. – less",Adult Speech Therapist,$65K-$118K,Adult speech therapy Speech-language assessment Rehabilitation techniques Swallowing disorders Communication skills,Tunisia,79882,Tunis

With operations in more than 50 countries and 25,000 employees worldwide, Avery Dennison serves customers with insights and innovations that help make brands more inspiring and the world more intelligent.
Avery Dennison Corporation (NYSE: AVY) is a Fortune 500® company with sales of $6 billion from continuing operations in 2015. We are based in Glendale, California.

The Avery Dennison story begins in 1935, with just a few spare parts, one very bright idea and a $100 loan.

Ray Stanton (“Stan”) Avery, a struggling clerk in Los Angeles, invented a smarter way for stores to price their products, then went on to pioneer the labeling industry.

With a few simple materials—primarily used machine parts and a saber saw—Stan created and patented the first self-adhesive, die-cut labeling machine. His practical genius would ultimately yield eighteen patents and establish Avery Adhesives as the company that transformed how brands and businesses deliver information. In 1990, Avery International merged with Dennison Manufacturing to become Avery Dennison.

Today, we manufacture and distribute labeling and packaging materials in over 50 countries and employ more than 25,000 people. The flexibility and responsiveness afforded by our company's global footprint enables us to service our customers at key points throughout their supply chain.

In just over 80 years we have grown from one bright idea into a global corporation that continues to set new standards for quality and innovation in materials science.

Avery Dennison manufactures and distributes display graphics, labeling and packaging materials, retail graphic embellishments and RFID tags that companies around the world use to engage customers and efficiently manage their inventories. Our products are virtually everywhere you look, providing a crucial thread in the fabric of global commerce.

We sustain Stan Avery's spirit of curiosity through research, invention and development of new materials science products and processes. Our expertise in high-speed manufacturing, information display and management, logistics, branding, graphics and packaging enables us to impact a wide array of markets—from consumer packaged goods and apparel to transportation, architecture and healthcare.

We strive to make each customer's brand more inspiring and every process more intelligent.

Avery Dennison's extensive experience in our core businesses allows us to purchase, process, and deliver needed materials to key points in our customers' supply chains with rapid and globally consistent execution.

In the 21st century, the company will expand its footprint in emerging markets.

The pursuit of this vision has compelled us to align our businesses into a focused, customer-driven company that specializes in materials science. Our in-depth pool of expertise and global scale enable us to deliver insights, innovative products and intelligent solutions to customers all over the world. – less",Brand Manager,$61K-$120K,Brand strategy development Brand identity and design Brand storytelling Marketing campaigns Brand performance measurement Creative thinking Strong communication skills,Japan,212221,Tokyo

The holding company distributes electricity to 2.4 million customers and natural gas to 900,000 customers in Missouri and Illinois through utility subsidiaries. Ameren has a generating capacity of 16,000 MW (primarily coal-fired), most of which is controlled by utility Union Electric (which does business as Ameren Missouri) and nonregulated subsidiary AmerenEnergy Resources Generating Company. Ameren, which also supplies merchant generation power to third parties, operates a nuclear power facility, three hydroelectric plants, and several coal-fired plants and turbine combustion facilities. It also purchases power, including windpower.

Operations

In addition to operating power plants, Ameren procures natural gas for its affiliated companies, builds new power plants, and provides long-term energy supply contracts. It also markets and trades electricity to wholesale and retail customers and provides risk management and other energy-related services.

Financial Analysis

Ameren's overall revenues dipped in 2011. While increased rates helped to lift Ameren Missouri's revenues in 2011, Ameren Illinois' regulated segment and the merchant generation segment both reported a drop in revenues. In particular, low gas prices and a warm winter hurt gas revenues. However, lower purchased power and resale gas, coupled with a drop in goodwill, impairment, and other charges, helped to lift Ameren's net income for the year.

Favorable weather conditions (which increased energy demand) and rate increases help to lift the company's revenues in 2010. However, impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets in the merchant generation segment (due to the sustained decline in market prices for electricity) dragged down Ameren's operating income.

Strategy

In 2010 the company combined AmerenIP, AmerenCIPS, and AmerenCILCO into one entity, Ameren Illinois, in order to streamline operations and reduce confusion among customers. The three Illinois utilities have operated as a single business since 2004 and deliver energy to more than 1,100 communities. Ameren Illinois also operates some 21,400 miles of natural gas distribution and transmission lines.

To comply with federal requirements to separate ownership of power generation and transmission businesses, the operations of Ameren subsidiaries' transmission assets are under the control ofMidwest Independent Transmission System Operator, a regional transmission organization that coordinates power across 15 Midwestern states and one Canadian Province.  – less",Office Manager,$60K-$118K,Office administration and management Budgeting and expense tracking Team coordination and supervision Facility management Vendor and supplier relations,Malaysia,100524,Kuala Lumpur

It focuses on exploration and production assets in Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming, and western Canada. In 2011 Devon Energy reported proved reserves of 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent (58% natural gas) and more than 19,900 net acres of assets. It also drilled almost 2,500 gross wells. Devon Energy produces about 2.5 billion cu. ft. of natural gas a day (more than 3% of all the gas consumed in North America). The company is the largest producer and lease holder in the Barnett Shale (Texas) and is looking to replicate its success there to other unconventional plays.

Geographic Reach

Once active in major oil patches worldwide such as Azerbaijan, Brazil, and China, in the mid-2000s the company decided to focus on safer and increasingly productive unconventional onshore exploration opportunities (shales and oil sands) in North America. As a result, Devon Energy has sold all of its international assets.

Financial Analysis

Devon Energy posted a major improvement in revenues in 2010, thanks to higher commodity prices and an increase in production. In 2011, buoyed by record level reserves, high oil prices, and an increased demand for oil and gas products, the company posted a further 15% growth in revenues. Net income only rose by 3%, however, as higher operating, depreciation, deletion, and amortization costs and an increase in deferred income tax expense trimmed income growth.

Boosting its financial resources, in 2012 Devon Energy secured a commitment from Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration & Production for the Chinese company to invest $2.2 billion in exchange for one-third of Devon's interest in five new joint venture plays in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, Niobrara, Mississippian, Ohio Utica Shale, and the Michigan Basin.

That year it also closed a similar $1.4 billion joint venture deal with Sumitomo Corp. to develop 650,000 net acres in the Cline Shale and the Midland-Wolfcamp Shale in West Texas.

Strategy

In 2010 it sold most of its remaining international assets to BP for $7 billion. As part of this deal BP sold undeveloped oil sand leases in Canada to Devon Energy for $500 million and formed a joint venture with the company to exploit them. The company also sold its Panyu field, offshore China, to China National Offshore Oil for $515 million.

Consolidating its North American assets to just its onshore properties, In 2010 Devon Energy sold its stakes in the Cascade, Jack and St. Malo fields in the Gulf of Mexico (about 200 million barrels of estimated recoverable reserves) to AP Moller-Maersk's oil unit for $1.3 billion. It also sold its remaining Gulf of Mexico shelf assets to Apache for $1 billion. – less",Sustainable Design Specialist,$60K-$80K,Sustainable design principles Energy efficiency LEED certification Green building materials Environmental impact assessment,Turks and Caicos Islands,176788,Cockburn Town

We have been satisfying consumers, delivering shareholder value and creating valued employment for over a century. However, we are entering the most dynamic period of change our industry has ever encountered.

Our acquisition of Reynolds American Inc. (RAI) in July 2017, which has transformed both the scale and geographic reach of our business and our portfolio of potentially reduced-risk products, now positions us perfectly to capitalise on this ambition.

The utility holding company distributes electricity to 3.4 million customers and natural gas to 1.9 million in eight states through four regulated utilities; Colorado and Minnesota account for most of its customers. Its utilities -- Northern States Power (NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin), Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service (in New Mexico and Texas) -- have the combined capacity of more than 17,150 MW of electricity. Xcel owns transmission and distribution lines, as well as natural gas assets. It is also the top wind power provider in the US, with wind farms in Colorado, Minnesota, and Texas.

Geographic Reach

The company serves customers in Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin.

 

Operations

Xcel operates power and gas utilities: Northern States Power, Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service. The holding company has more than 80 generating plants, more than 87,750 miles of transmission lines and about 191,840 miles of distribution lines. It also operates an interstate natural gas pipeline company and a joint venture to develop and lease natural gas pipelines, storage, and compression assets.

Financial Analysis

In 2011 Xcel reported a 3% jump in sales due to an increase in demand caused by a warmer-than-normal summer and a colder-than-normal winter. It was also assisted by a 3.7% increase in the electric segment due to cost recovery of the acquisition of the Rocky Mountain and Blue Spruce natural gas facilities by Public Service Company of Colorado and by natural gas retail rate increases in Minnesota.

Net income rose by 11% thanks to higher revenues and lower electric fuel and purchased power costs.

Higher rates and increased weather-related demand helped sales in 2010 to rise nearly 7%, going from $9.6 billion to about $10.3 billion. 

Strategy

Xcel is an energy company in transition, with long-term plans to move from coal-fired plants to natural gas, and on to alternative fuels such as wind, solar, and biomass to boost its green  power capacity (88,705 MWh by 2015).

In 2012 the company was seeking proposals for renewable resources other than wind or solar as part of its plan to diversify Southwestern Public Service Company  renewable energy portfolio.

As the largest US utility wind energy provider, Xcel controlled some 3,500 MW of wind energy in its portfolio in 2011 and plans to have 7,400 MW by 2020. In 2011 Xcel bought the 200 MW Limon Wind Energy Center, which will have 125 turbines in Lincoln and Elbert counties on Colorado's Front Range east of Denver. The company is also the US's fifth-largest utility solar energy provider and owns the fourth-largest transmission system. In addition, Xcel operates more than 25 hydroelectric power plants in Colorado, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.

The company believes its strategy of making environmentally sound investments is pivotal to its success. Among its 2010 projects were launching its 800-MW coal-fired unit in Colorado, known as Comanche 3, after installing advanced emission-reduction equipment. It also began construction of its CapX2020 project, a joint venture transmission expansion project with 10 other utilities, scheduled for completion by 2020. The project includes a 240-mile transmission line from Minnesota to North Dakota. The company has filed to extend the licensing plants of its two nuclear plants on Prairie Island in Minnesota for 20 years, which it expects to save customers more than $1 billion compared to alternative sources.

Xcel plans to construct one of the largest biomass generating plants in the Midwest. The facility, proposed for the Bay Front Generating Station in Ashland, Wisconsin, will generate power from burning wood waste in all three operating units by 2014. In 2011 Xcel had 73 MW of biomass generating power in Minnesota and Wisconsin.

Xcel is also working to develop so-called ""smart grid"" technology, which will provide customers with more reliability and control over their energy use. It has completed the nation's first fully integrated SmartGridCity in Boulder, Colorado.

In 2010 Xcel acquired two gas-fired power plants from Calpine Corporation for $739 million. The two Denver-area plants have a generating capacity of more than 900 MW and were already providing power to Public Service Company of Colorado under a contract agreement. The company is planning to acquire 775 MW of new wind-power capacity for its Colorado system over the next several years. – less",Logistics Manager,$61K-$125K,Supply chain management Inventory control Transportation logistics Vendor relations Team leadership and management,Timor-Leste,213174,Dili

It focuses on exploration and production assets in Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming, and western Canada. In 2011 Devon Energy reported proved reserves of 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent (58% natural gas) and more than 19,900 net acres of assets. It also drilled almost 2,500 gross wells. Devon Energy produces about 2.5 billion cu. ft. of natural gas a day (more than 3% of all the gas consumed in North America). The company is the largest producer and lease holder in the Barnett Shale (Texas) and is looking to replicate its success there to other unconventional plays.

Geographic Reach

Once active in major oil patches worldwide such as Azerbaijan, Brazil, and China, in the mid-2000s the company decided to focus on safer and increasingly productive unconventional onshore exploration opportunities (shales and oil sands) in North America. As a result, Devon Energy has sold all of its international assets.

Financial Analysis

Devon Energy posted a major improvement in revenues in 2010, thanks to higher commodity prices and an increase in production. In 2011, buoyed by record level reserves, high oil prices, and an increased demand for oil and gas products, the company posted a further 15% growth in revenues. Net income only rose by 3%, however, as higher operating, depreciation, deletion, and amortization costs and an increase in deferred income tax expense trimmed income growth.

Boosting its financial resources, in 2012 Devon Energy secured a commitment from Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration & Production for the Chinese company to invest $2.2 billion in exchange for one-third of Devon's interest in five new joint venture plays in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, Niobrara, Mississippian, Ohio Utica Shale, and the Michigan Basin.

That year it also closed a similar $1.4 billion joint venture deal with Sumitomo Corp. to develop 650,000 net acres in the Cline Shale and the Midland-Wolfcamp Shale in West Texas.

Strategy

In 2010 it sold most of its remaining international assets to BP for $7 billion. As part of this deal BP sold undeveloped oil sand leases in Canada to Devon Energy for $500 million and formed a joint venture with the company to exploit them. The company also sold its Panyu field, offshore China, to China National Offshore Oil for $515 million.

Consolidating its North American assets to just its onshore properties, In 2010 Devon Energy sold its stakes in the Cascade, Jack and St. Malo fields in the Gulf of Mexico (about 200 million barrels of estimated recoverable reserves) to AP Moller-Maersk's oil unit for $1.3 billion. It also sold its remaining Gulf of Mexico shelf assets to Apache for $1 billion. – less",Investment Portfolio Manager,$64K-$89K,Investment analysis Portfolio management Risk assessment,Tuvalu,176055,Funafuti

A part of top US power firm Duke Energy, the regulated utility provides electricity services to about 2.4 million customers in North and South Carolina. Operating in a 24,000-square mile service territory, Duke Energy Carolinas has 101,400 miles of distribution cable. Its transmission system spans 13,100 miles. The utility has a net generating capacity of about 19,200 MW from interests in fossil-fueled, nuclear, and hydroelectric power plants. Duke Energy Carolinas also sells power to wholesale customers.

The utility's three nuclear plants account for more than a quarter of Duke Energy Carolinas' generating capacity.

Duke Energy Carolinas is investing $7 billion from 2010 to 2012 to expand its generating capacity and maintain its nuclear fuel and plants. By 2020 the company is looking to expand capacity by 5,400 MW, a strategy that brings new plants online while replacing older, less efficient ones.

The global recession produced weaker demand for power (especially from industrial customers) which lowered company revenues in 2009. However, the same downturn cut fuel expenses (including purchased power from third parties) resulting in only a slight dip in Duke Energy Carolinas' operating income.

In 2010 the company saw its revenues rise, primarily due to new retail electric base rates in North Carolina and South Carolina, and favorable weather conditions which spurred demand. Duke Energy Carolinas also posted higher net income, despite an increase in fuel costs and expenses related to an employee voluntary severance plan. – less",Live Chat Support Agent,$59K-$81K,Live chat support Online customer communication Problem resolution,Trinidad and Tobago,4202,Port of Spain
Western Digital,"{'Work Happiness Score': '69', 'Achievement': '79', 'Appreciation': '74', 'Flexibility': '74', 'Learning': '73', 'Purpose': '71', 'Trust': '69', 'Compensation': '69', 'Support': '69', 'Inclusion': '68', 'Energy': '67', 'Belonging': '66', 'Management': '65'}",3.8,"When it comes to data storage, Western Digital has drive. The company is one of the largest independent makers of hard-disk drives, which record, store, and recall volumes of data. Drives for PCs account for most of Western Digital's sales, although the company also makes devices used in servers, cloud computing data centers, and home entertainment products such as set-top boxes and video game consoles. The company sells to manufacturers and through retailers and distributors. More than 60% of its sales are to OEMs such as  Hewlett-Packard, which is Western Digital's largest customer. The company gets more than half of its sales from the Asia/Pacific region.

Operations

Western Digital is structured around two subsidiaries: WD Technologies and Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST). Each subsidiary maintains its own brand and product lines, with separate sales, marketing, operations, and product development teams. The company is looking to offer improved customer experiences for competing and complementary brands, while finding efficiencies in shared services.

Geographic Reach

The company is seeing strong growth in Asia (which represents more than 55% of sales) and the US (nearly 20%), with slower growth in the EMEA region (another nearly 20%). Western Digital has manufacturing facilities in the US and across Asia and sales offices worldwide.

Strategy

Western Digital is one of a handful of manufacturers that dominate the hard-disk drive market -- a sector characterized by harsh competition, short product life cycles, and aggressive price cuts. In order to reduce its dependence on drives for PCs, the company has branched into branded consumer media devices, including DVR expanders, portable media drives, and media players that let users play data from external drives on TV. Its WD TV Live Plus media player streams movies (including those offered by Netflix) and Internet video to a digital TV. It is also investing in products for the mobile computing and cloud computing markets.

Another promising market for Western Digital is nearline hard drives, which are more cost effective than traditional hard drives by providing more capacity while requiring lower power. Nearline hard drives are used for stimulated applications, such as video surveillance and medical imaging, and IT infrastructure applications, including scientific computing and Web search engines.

Mergers & Acquisitions

In 2012 Western Digital bought Hitachi's disk drive business, HGST, for around $4.3 billion in cash and stock. The deal boosts Western Digital's share of the global market to nearly 50%, ahead of rival Seagate Technology which accounts for around 30% of global shipments. Strategically, the deal adds disk drives used with servers -- a large part of both Hitachi and Seagate's businesses -- and gives Western Digital a better foothold in solid-state drives used in tablets and other portable devices. The acquisition also provides Western Digital its first manufacturing foothold in China and the Philippines. With the stock portion of the sale, Hitachi gains a 10% stake in Western Digital and two spots on the board of directors.

Western Digital has long used acquisitions to add new product lines and extend its geographic reach. Over the past several years it bought the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya for about $233 million and entered the market for solid-state drives with the $65 million purchase of SiliconSystems. In a large 2007 acquisition, Western Digital bought disk component maker Komag for $1 billion, which gave it the ability to manufacture the media and substrates used in its drives.

Financial Analysis

Western Digital's sales have fluctuated in recent years as it has dealt with the worldwide economic downturn. However, its acquisition of HGST helped produce strong results for fiscal 2012 (ended June 30). The company's revenues grew 31% that year to $12.5 billion, with HGST contributing more than $3 billion of that. It also saw an improvement in hard drive average selling price from $45 in fiscal 2011 to $62 in fiscal 2012.

Although Western Digital saw increased R&D and SG&A expenses in 2012, the overall strength of revenues led to a 122% jump in net income (to $1.6 billion). – less",Bridge Engineer,$61K-$92K,Bridge design Civil engineering Structural analysis AutoCAD proficiency Project management,Lithuania,44053,Vilnius

It also offers a variety of investment products and services for individuals, businesses, and pension plans. Subsidiary Pacific Life & Annuity offers the same mix of life insurance and investment products and services for individuals and businesses in New York. Pacific Life was founded in 1868.

Operations

Pacific Life policyholders are members of parent Pacific Mutual Holding Company, which was created in 1997 following a conversion to the mutual holding company structure. Pacific LifeCorp is the intermediate stock holding company.

While life insurance is the company's bread and butter, it has brought in other operations for variety.

It also manages aircraft assets for third parties such as commercial airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and financial institutions. Other subsidiaries include Pacific Asset Management, which provides third-party institutional asset management.

Sales & Marketing

Pacific Life's insurance policies are sold through independent distributors and through dealer/broker subsidiary Pacific Select Distributors.

Financial Analysis

The company's growth strategies helped Pacific Life achieve strong results in 2011, with revenues increasing 15% over 2010 to almost 6.7 billion, and net income increasing 29% to $679 million. Its operating income climbed a whopping 40% over 2010 to reach $823 million. The gains achieved were attributed to enhanced service offerings, expanded life insurance, annuity, and mutual fund product offerings, and the two acquisitions made that year.

Strategy

Being a mutual company, Pacific Life operates with a long-term focus to serve in the best interests of its policyholders and clients. in doing so, the company navigated the chilly economic waters of the 2008-2009 recession by steadily introducing new products and building up its capital reserves. By 2010 its net income had grown as risk-weary customers squirreled more of their savings and retirement monies into life insurance and mutual funds.

Mergers, Acquisitions & Divestitures

In 2008 the company added international reinsurance to its portfolio when it acquired the former London-based specialty reinsurance operations of Scottish Re and renamed the business as Pacific Life Re. It then added life retrocession (reinsurance of a reinsurer) to its line-up in 2011 by acquiring that business from Manulife and expanded its business to include the Toronto, Boston, Barbados, and Cologne markets.

Also in 2011 Pacific life bought JPMorgan Chase's pension risk advisory business to form Pacific Global Advisors. The unit offers risk management solutions and advisory services to pension plan sponsors.

The company is one of the largest independent makers of hard-disk drives, which record, store, and recall volumes of data. Drives for PCs account for most of Western Digital's sales, although the company also makes devices used in servers, cloud computing data centers, and home entertainment products such as set-top boxes and video game consoles. The company sells to manufacturers and through retailers and distributors. More than 60% of its sales are to OEMs such as  Hewlett-Packard, which is Western Digital's largest customer. The company gets more than half of its sales from the Asia/Pacific region.

Operations

Western Digital is structured around two subsidiaries: WD Technologies and Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST). Each subsidiary maintains its own brand and product lines, with separate sales, marketing, operations, and product development teams. The company is looking to offer improved customer experiences for competing and complementary brands, while finding efficiencies in shared services.

Geographic Reach

The company is seeing strong growth in Asia (which represents more than 55% of sales) and the US (nearly 20%), with slower growth in the EMEA region (another nearly 20%). Western Digital has manufacturing facilities in the US and across Asia and sales offices worldwide.

Strategy

Western Digital is one of a handful of manufacturers that dominate the hard-disk drive market -- a sector characterized by harsh competition, short product life cycles, and aggressive price cuts. In order to reduce its dependence on drives for PCs, the company has branched into branded consumer media devices, including DVR expanders, portable media drives, and media players that let users play data from external drives on TV. Its WD TV Live Plus media player streams movies (including those offered by Netflix) and Internet video to a digital TV. It is also investing in products for the mobile computing and cloud computing markets.

Another promising market for Western Digital is nearline hard drives, which are more cost effective than traditional hard drives by providing more capacity while requiring lower power. Nearline hard drives are used for stimulated applications, such as video surveillance and medical imaging, and IT infrastructure applications, including scientific computing and Web search engines.

Mergers & Acquisitions

In 2012 Western Digital bought Hitachi's disk drive business, HGST, for around $4.3 billion in cash and stock. The deal boosts Western Digital's share of the global market to nearly 50%, ahead of rival Seagate Technology which accounts for around 30% of global shipments. Strategically, the deal adds disk drives used with servers -- a large part of both Hitachi and Seagate's businesses -- and gives Western Digital a better foothold in solid-state drives used in tablets and other portable devices. The acquisition also provides Western Digital its first manufacturing foothold in China and the Philippines. With the stock portion of the sale, Hitachi gains a 10% stake in Western Digital and two spots on the board of directors.

Western Digital has long used acquisitions to add new product lines and extend its geographic reach. Over the past several years it bought the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya for about $233 million and entered the market for solid-state drives with the $65 million purchase of SiliconSystems. In a large 2007 acquisition, Western Digital bought disk component maker Komag for $1 billion, which gave it the ability to manufacture the media and substrates used in its drives.

Financial Analysis

Western Digital's sales have fluctuated in recent years as it has dealt with the worldwide economic downturn. However, its acquisition of HGST helped produce strong results for fiscal 2012 (ended June 30). The company's revenues grew 31% that year to $12.5 billion, with HGST contributing more than $3 billion of that. It also saw an improvement in hard drive average selling price from $45 in fiscal 2011 to $62 in fiscal 2012.

Although Western Digital saw increased R&D and SG&A expenses in 2012, the overall strength of revenues led to a 122% jump in net income (to $1.6 billion). – less",Mediator,$65K-$125K,Mediation Conflict resolution Negotiation Communication skills Neutrality Problem-solving Legal knowledge Mediation techniques,Niger,45265,Niamey

The regulated utility, a subsidiary of Entergy, distributes electricity to 161,000 residential, commercial, and industrial customers and natural gas to more than 100,000 customers in Orleans Parish, Louisiana; it also owns two generating stations that give it more than 930 MW of generating capacity. 

Entergy New Orleans provides regulated electric and gas utility services to the population of New Orleans.

As a result of the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection a few weeks later; it emerged from bankruptcy in 2007.

After the onslaught of wind and rain caused by Katrina subsided, the city of New Orleans was left crippled and Entergy New Orleans' employees were scrambling to restore power to the city's pumping stations. The company was forced to create an interim headquarters in Clinton, Mississippi (a suburb of Jackson).

The mass evacuation and property damage caused by Hurricane Katrina severely reduced the population served by Entergy New Orleans. Before the big storm it had more than 190,000 electric customers and more than 144,000 gas customers.

The company reported a 10% drop in net revenue in 2011 due to lower electric rates and weak gas prices. However, net income jumped by $4.9 million thanks to lower operational and maintenance expenses, lower taxes, and lower interest expense.

To gain better financial returns, Entergy  plans to spin off its transmission businesses (including Entergy New Orleans') and merge them with a subsidiary of ITC Holdings.

In 2012, as part of a strategy to improve customer relations, Entergy New Orleans introduced a smartphone app to keep customers better informed about company and energy-related matters. – less",Network Performance Analyst,$57K-$105K,"Network performance analysis Network monitoring tools (e.g., Wireshark) Troubleshooting Capacity planning Data analysis Network protocols",Isle of Man,106361,Douglas

We are a leading, multi-category consumer goods company that provides tobacco and nicotine products to hundreds of millions of adult consumers worldwide.

For decades, we have built our business on successfully meeting the preferences of adult smokers with world-famous cigarette brands, superior blends and market-leading innovations.

We have been satisfying consumers, delivering shareholder value and creating valued employment for over a century. However, we are entering the most dynamic period of change our industry has ever encountered.

An unprecedented confluence of technology, societal change and public health awareness has created a unique opportunity: the opportunity to make a substantial leap forward in our long-held ambition to provide our consumers with potentially reduced-risk tobacco and nicotine choices.

Our acquisition of Reynolds American Inc. (RAI) in July 2017, which has transformed both the scale and geographic reach of our business and our portfolio of potentially reduced-risk products, now positions us perfectly to capitalise on this ambition.

We call this ambition Transforming Tobacco and we are fully committed to leading this transformation.


The way our people operate is embodied in our four Guiding Principles: Enterprising Spirit, Freedom Through Responsibility, Open Minded and Strength from Diversity. These principles underpin our culture and guide how we deliver our strategy.

The culture of the Group is about developing talent from within, stretching and supporting the high performing managers who will lead the delivery of our strategy. In 2017, over 92% of our senior appointments were drawn from people already within the business – moves that have helped deliver stronger and more diverse leadership teams.

Our employer brand – ‘Bring your Difference’ – has a strong presence across social media channels, including LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram. We are leading our industry in social media engagement and have moved ahead of several top FMCG companies.

Providing a safe place to work, protecting our employees’ wellbeing and listening to their views are also fundamental.


Proud to be a Top Employer

We are proud of the external recognition we receive each year for our standing as a leading employer in countries worldwide.

In February 2019, we were recognised as a Global Top Employer for 2019 by the Top Employers Institute after being named as a Top Employer in 35 markets and in five regions – Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific, Africa and Middle East.

This global accolade reflects our commitment to nurturing and furthering the careers of our 55,000 people worldwide.

The bank is primarily active in the UK, where it has some 1,700 branches, but also has significant retail and commercial operations in Europe, Africa (it owns more than half of South African bank Absa Group), the Middle East, and the US. Barclays Bank offers standard retail services such as deposit accounts and lending, including Woolwich-brand mortgages. The bank also provides commercial money transfer services, insurance products, the Barclaycard line of credit cards, and financial advisory services. Barclays Bank traces its roots to the late 17th century.

Barclays Bank has been building up its portfolio of global credit card accounts, especially as other financial groups sell off noncore units during the economic recovery. In 2010 the company acquired the Italian credit card accounts of Citigroup in a deal that included some 197,000 card accounts and approximately €234 million ($320 million) worth of assets. It previously bought Goldfish, the struggling UK credit card unit of Discover Financial Services, for some £46 million ($70 million). In 2011 Barclays acquired Egg UK's credit card portfolio, which added more than 1 million accounts; it has agreed to buy more Citibank card accounts.

The bank has also been offloading some of its own holdings as part of an overall corporate restructuring. In 2010 Barclays sold its US subprime loan servicing business, HomEq Servicing, to Ocwen Financial. It also announced plans to abandon retail banking in certain international markets and instead focus on wholesale and commercial banking. In 2011 it shuttered its Indonesian retail unit Bank Akita, which it had acquired only two years before. The company also sold its Russian retail and commercial operations to a group of investors, citing difficulties competing in the market. Barclays will instead focus on its investment banking activities in the region.

In 2010 Barclays acquired Standard Life Bank from Standard Life for £226 million ($369 million). The deal added Standard Life's savings and mortgage books to the Barclays fold. Also as part of the deal, Barclays and Standard Life entered into a partnership whereby Barclays markets pension products to its clients.

Despite challenges in the economy, especially in regards to Europe's debt problems, Barclays Bank's revenues grew 8% in 2011. Its Africa business performed relatively strongly, with credit impairments improving, as did Barclaycard, thanks to the portfolio acquisitions which delivered profits. That year the bank closed nearly 150 European branches (largely located in Spain), the costs of which contributed to a 5% decline in net income. – less",Data Analyst Researcher,$60K-$105K,"Data analysis techniques Research methodologies Data collection and interpretation Statistical analysis software (e.g., R, Python) Data visualization tools (e.g., Tableau, Power BI) Research report writing Critical thinking Problem-solving Communication skills Attention to detail","Macao SAR, China",233375,Macao

The bank is primarily active in the UK, where it has some 1,700 branches, but also has significant retail and commercial operations in Europe, Africa (it owns more than half of South African bank Absa Group), the Middle East, and the US. Barclays Bank offers standard retail services such as deposit accounts and lending, including Woolwich-brand mortgages. The bank also provides commercial money transfer services, insurance products, the Barclaycard line of credit cards, and financial advisory services. Barclays Bank traces its roots to the late 17th century.

Barclays Bank has been building up its portfolio of global credit card accounts, especially as other financial groups sell off noncore units during the economic recovery. In 2010 the company acquired the Italian credit card accounts of Citigroup in a deal that included some 197,000 card accounts and approximately €234 million ($320 million) worth of assets. It previously bought Goldfish, the struggling UK credit card unit of Discover Financial Services, for some £46 million ($70 million). In 2011 Barclays acquired Egg UK's credit card portfolio, which added more than 1 million accounts; it has agreed to buy more Citibank card accounts.

The bank has also been offloading some of its own holdings as part of an overall corporate restructuring. In 2010 Barclays sold its US subprime loan servicing business, HomEq Servicing, to Ocwen Financial. It also announced plans to abandon retail banking in certain international markets and instead focus on wholesale and commercial banking. In 2011 it shuttered its Indonesian retail unit Bank Akita, which it had acquired only two years before. The company also sold its Russian retail and commercial operations to a group of investors, citing difficulties competing in the market. Barclays will instead focus on its investment banking activities in the region.

In 2010 Barclays acquired Standard Life Bank from Standard Life for £226 million ($369 million). The deal added Standard Life's savings and mortgage books to the Barclays fold. Also as part of the deal, Barclays and Standard Life entered into a partnership whereby Barclays markets pension products to its clients.

Despite challenges in the economy, especially in regards to Europe's debt problems, Barclays Bank's revenues grew 8% in 2011. Its Africa business performed relatively strongly, with credit impairments improving, as did Barclaycard, thanks to the portfolio acquisitions which delivered profits. That year the bank closed nearly 150 European branches (largely located in Spain), the costs of which contributed to a 5% decline in net income. – less",Exotic Animal Veterinarian,$60K-$120K,Exotic animal medicine Exotic animal diagnostics Specialized surgical skills Avian medicine Reptile care Amphibian care Exotic animal anesthesia Compassion and empathy Client communication Problem-solving Attention to detail,Portugal,233663,Lisbon

It also engages in natural gas compressing, treating, processing, transporting, and selling. DCP Midstream LLC also transports and sells NGLs and distributes propane wholesale. The company operates natural gas gathering systems (5,300 miles of pipe) in eight states (including Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas), seven processing plants, four NGL pipelines, and nine propane storage terminals. Spectra Energy holds a 50% holding in DCP (ConocoPhillips holds the other 50%).

A consolidator in the fragmented natural gas gathering, NGLs, and wholesale propane industry segments, the company has been expanding its gas supply base and its propane wholesale network in recent years through strategic complementary acquisitions and joint ventures.

In 2012 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Texas-based Crossroads processing plant and gathering system from Penn Virginia Resource Partners for $63 million. The bolt-on acquisition allows the company to expand its market position in East Texas and provide services to drillers in the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley regions.

In 2011 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Seaway Products Pipeline Co. from ConocoPhillips. The pipeline, now called Southern Hills Pipeline and being converted to NGL service, is expected to be operational by mid-2013. It will provide NGL access from the Midcontinent to the Texas Gulf Coast.

The company agreed to form a joint venture with EQT Corporation to develop natural gas processing and related natural gas liquid (NGL) infrastructure in the Marcellus and Huron shale plays in the Appalachian basin. (However, the parties could not come to agreement and dropped the plan in early 2011). In 2010, the company acquired the Liberty gathering system and south Raywood processing plant from Ceritas Energy in southeast Texas. The pipeline system interconnects with DCP Midstream's Centana Intrastate Pipeline system.

Expanding in Michigan, in 2009 the company acquired gas gathering and treating assets for $45.1 million. In 2010 it acquired a 350-mile interstate natural gas liquids pipeline system in Colorado's Denver-Julesburg Basin from Buckeye Partners for $22 million.

In 2010 DCP Midstream Partners moved to extend its Northeast wholesale propane business into the MidAtlantic region, acquiring UGI's Atlantic Energy for $49 million. That year it also purchased of NGL storage company Marysville Hydrocarbon Holdings (in Michigan) for about $95 million.

Although DCP Midstream Partners' revenues suffered in 2009 as a result of the global recession and lower commodity prices, acquisitions and organic growth managed to offset lower natural gas volumes.  Acquisitions, increased demand, higher commodity and propane prices, and gains on derivatives help to lift the company's revenues and net income in 2010.

In terms of the company's origins, the D in DCP Midstream Partners (formerly Duke Energy Field Services) is for Duke Energy; the CP, ConocoPhillips. These two energy majors formed DCP Midstream Partners in 2005. Following the spinoff of Spectra Energy from Duke Energy in 2007, Spectra Energy assumed Duke Energy's 50% holding in DCP. – less",Corporate Paralegal,$56K-$112K,Corporate legal tasks Document drafting Compliance Corporate governance Contract management Due diligence Entity formation Communication with stakeholders Attention to detail Technology proficiency Legal software proficiency Legal research skills,Sri Lanka,25820,Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte

CenterPoint Energy's regulated utilities distribute natural gas to 3.3 million customers in six US states and electricity to more than 2 million customers on the Texas Gulf Coast. The company's main stomping ground is Texas, where it has regulated power distribution operations through subsidiary CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric. CenterPoint Energy operates more than 48,230 miles of power distribution lines, 8,000 miles of interstate gas pipeline, and 3,800 miles of gas gathering pipeline. It also provides natural gas field services. 

Operations

The company's natural gas distribution subsidiaries serve customers in Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas.

CenterPoint Energy also markets natural gas and related services to 12,200 commercial, industrial, and wholesale customers located primarily in the eastern US. It also provides HVAC and other energy-related services through its gas division.

Financial Analysis

CenterPoint Energy's sales dropped dramatically in 2009 as the global recession prompted a slump in commodity prices which hurt the performance of its different energy segments. A reviving economy in 2010 led to a stronger demand for power and gas (coupled with rate increases and weather-related spikes in consumption) resulting in a overall jump in revenues and net income that year.

Strategy

CenterPoint Energy's strategy is focused on enhancing and expanding existing core operations, while acquiring complementary and synergistic businesses. In 2011 the company acquired Denver-based natural gas marketing firm Asgard Energy, which supplies gas to agricultural, commercial, industrial, and residential customers in five states (Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, and West Virginia). The acquisition fit into CenterPoint's strategy to expand into the Rockies and diversify into residential choice markets.

Avery Dennison Corporation (NYSE: AVY) is a Fortune 500® company with sales of $6 billion from continuing operations in 2015. We are based in Glendale, California.

The Avery Dennison story begins in 1935, with just a few spare parts, one very bright idea and a $100 loan.

Ray Stanton (“Stan”) Avery, a struggling clerk in Los Angeles, invented a smarter way for stores to price their products, then went on to pioneer the labeling industry.

With a few simple materials—primarily used machine parts and a saber saw—Stan created and patented the first self-adhesive, die-cut labeling machine. His practical genius would ultimately yield eighteen patents and establish Avery Adhesives as the company that transformed how brands and businesses deliver information. In 1990, Avery International merged with Dennison Manufacturing to become Avery Dennison.

Today, we manufacture and distribute labeling and packaging materials in over 50 countries and employ more than 25,000 people. The flexibility and responsiveness afforded by our company's global footprint enables us to service our customers at key points throughout their supply chain.

In just over 80 years we have grown from one bright idea into a global corporation that continues to set new standards for quality and innovation in materials science.

Avery Dennison manufactures and distributes display graphics, labeling and packaging materials, retail graphic embellishments and RFID tags that companies around the world use to engage customers and efficiently manage their inventories. Our products are virtually everywhere you look, providing a crucial thread in the fabric of global commerce.

We sustain Stan Avery's spirit of curiosity through research, invention and development of new materials science products and processes. Our expertise in high-speed manufacturing, information display and management, logistics, branding, graphics and packaging enables us to impact a wide array of markets—from consumer packaged goods and apparel to transportation, architecture and healthcare.

We strive to make each customer's brand more inspiring and every process more intelligent.

Avery Dennison's extensive experience in our core businesses allows us to purchase, process, and deliver needed materials to key points in our customers' supply chains with rapid and globally consistent execution.

In the 21st century, the company will expand its footprint in emerging markets.

The company's primary operations include the manufacture of building block chemicals like acetic acid and vinyl acetate monomers. Those chemicals are used in everything from inks and paints to agricultural products and chewing gum. Canadian subsidiary Acetex, the majority of whose sales come from Europe, is the world's largest acetyls manufacturer. Other products include acetate tow (in cigarette filters); industrial specialties like ethylene vinyl aceta; and engineered plastics. The bulk of sales come from the US and Germany. 

Operations

Celanese operates through four business segments: Advanced Engineered Materials, Consumer Specialties, Industrial Specialties, and Acetyl Intermediates. The company is one of the world's largest producers of acetyl products, as well as a top global producer of engineered polymers.

Geographic Reach

In addition to manufacturing sites in the US, it also has properties, plants, and equipment in Belgium, China, Canada, Germany, Mexico, and Singapore.

Financial Analysis

Celanese continued its recovery from the recession of 2008-09 with a 14% increase in revenues in 2011, due primarily to higher volumes and increased sales prices across most of its business segments. The largest gains were in its Industrial Specialties unit (up 18%), Advanced Engineered Materials unit (up 17%), and its Acetyl Intermediates segment (up 15%). Net income grew by 61% in 2011, as increased revenues outpaced a more modest growth in operating expenses.

Strategy

Celanese's strategy is to grow the company through expansion into emerging regions, particularly China; to offer innovation through developing new products and applications; increase its productivity through energy reduction, business process improvements, and manufacturing optimization; and boost its portfolio by growing its business through both acquisitions or internal growth.

In 2012 the company teamed up with Indonesia's Pertamina, forming a joint venture to develop fuel ethanol projects in that country.

To grow its emulsion polymers business, in 2011 the company acquired two product lines, Vinac and Flexbond, from Ashland. The acquisition is expected to speed up growth of the company's emulsion polymers operations throughout the Americas -- especially in the adhesives, textiles, coatings, and paper segments.

Celanese subsidiary Ticona Engineering Polymers acquired two product lines, Zenite liquid crystal polymer and Thermx polycyclohexylene-dimethylene terephthalate, from DuPont Performance Polymers division in 2010. The units expanded Celanese's offerings in the electrical and electronics application segments of the global polymers market. 

Ownership

In 2012 Capital Research Global Investors owned about 11% of Celanese, with several other investment firms owning a smaller stakes.

Company Background

Celanese Corporation was created in 2004 by the Blackstone Group, which had acquired a majority share in Celanese AG, turned it private, and then flipped it in a 2005 public offering.

The utility holding company distributes electricity to 3.4 million customers and natural gas to 1.9 million in eight states through four regulated utilities; Colorado and Minnesota account for most of its customers. Its utilities -- Northern States Power (NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin), Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service (in New Mexico and Texas) -- have the combined capacity of more than 17,150 MW of electricity. Xcel owns transmission and distribution lines, as well as natural gas assets. It is also the top wind power provider in the US, with wind farms in Colorado, Minnesota, and Texas.

Geographic Reach

The company serves customers in Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin.

 

Operations

Xcel operates power and gas utilities: Northern States Power, Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service. The holding company has more than 80 generating plants, more than 87,750 miles of transmission lines and about 191,840 miles of distribution lines. It also operates an interstate natural gas pipeline company and a joint venture to develop and lease natural gas pipelines, storage, and compression assets.

Financial Analysis

In 2011 Xcel reported a 3% jump in sales due to an increase in demand caused by a warmer-than-normal summer and a colder-than-normal winter. It was also assisted by a 3.7% increase in the electric segment due to cost recovery of the acquisition of the Rocky Mountain and Blue Spruce natural gas facilities by Public Service Company of Colorado and by natural gas retail rate increases in Minnesota.

Net income rose by 11% thanks to higher revenues and lower electric fuel and purchased power costs.

Higher rates and increased weather-related demand helped sales in 2010 to rise nearly 7%, going from $9.6 billion to about $10.3 billion. 

Strategy

Xcel is an energy company in transition, with long-term plans to move from coal-fired plants to natural gas, and on to alternative fuels such as wind, solar, and biomass to boost its green  power capacity (88,705 MWh by 2015).

In 2012 the company was seeking proposals for renewable resources other than wind or solar as part of its plan to diversify Southwestern Public Service Company  renewable energy portfolio.

As the largest US utility wind energy provider, Xcel controlled some 3,500 MW of wind energy in its portfolio in 2011 and plans to have 7,400 MW by 2020. In 2011 Xcel bought the 200 MW Limon Wind Energy Center, which will have 125 turbines in Lincoln and Elbert counties on Colorado's Front Range east of Denver. The company is also the US's fifth-largest utility solar energy provider and owns the fourth-largest transmission system. In addition, Xcel operates more than 25 hydroelectric power plants in Colorado, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.

The company believes its strategy of making environmentally sound investments is pivotal to its success. Among its 2010 projects were launching its 800-MW coal-fired unit in Colorado, known as Comanche 3, after installing advanced emission-reduction equipment. It also began construction of its CapX2020 project, a joint venture transmission expansion project with 10 other utilities, scheduled for completion by 2020. The project includes a 240-mile transmission line from Minnesota to North Dakota. The company has filed to extend the licensing plants of its two nuclear plants on Prairie Island in Minnesota for 20 years, which it expects to save customers more than $1 billion compared to alternative sources.

Xcel plans to construct one of the largest biomass generating plants in the Midwest. The facility, proposed for the Bay Front Generating Station in Ashland, Wisconsin, will generate power from burning wood waste in all three operating units by 2014. In 2011 Xcel had 73 MW of biomass generating power in Minnesota and Wisconsin.

Xcel is also working to develop so-called ""smart grid"" technology, which will provide customers with more reliability and control over their energy use. It has completed the nation's first fully integrated SmartGridCity in Boulder, Colorado.

In 2010 Xcel acquired two gas-fired power plants from Calpine Corporation for $739 million. The two Denver-area plants have a generating capacity of more than 900 MW and were already providing power to Public Service Company of Colorado under a contract agreement. The company is planning to acquire 775 MW of new wind-power capacity for its Colorado system over the next several years. – less",Dental Hygiene Educator,$56K-$85K,Dental hygiene knowledge Teaching and instructional skills Curriculum development Student assessment Clinical practice experience,Philippines,213692,Manila

Avery Dennison Corporation (NYSE: AVY) is a Fortune 500® company with sales of $6 billion from continuing operations in 2015. We are based in Glendale, California.

The Avery Dennison story begins in 1935, with just a few spare parts, one very bright idea and a $100 loan.

Ray Stanton (“Stan”) Avery, a struggling clerk in Los Angeles, invented a smarter way for stores to price their products, then went on to pioneer the labeling industry.

With a few simple materials—primarily used machine parts and a saber saw—Stan created and patented the first self-adhesive, die-cut labeling machine. His practical genius would ultimately yield eighteen patents and establish Avery Adhesives as the company that transformed how brands and businesses deliver information. In 1990, Avery International merged with Dennison Manufacturing to become Avery Dennison.

Today, we manufacture and distribute labeling and packaging materials in over 50 countries and employ more than 25,000 people. The flexibility and responsiveness afforded by our company's global footprint enables us to service our customers at key points throughout their supply chain.

In just over 80 years we have grown from one bright idea into a global corporation that continues to set new standards for quality and innovation in materials science.

Avery Dennison manufactures and distributes display graphics, labeling and packaging materials, retail graphic embellishments and RFID tags that companies around the world use to engage customers and efficiently manage their inventories. Our products are virtually everywhere you look, providing a crucial thread in the fabric of global commerce.

We sustain Stan Avery's spirit of curiosity through research, invention and development of new materials science products and processes. Our expertise in high-speed manufacturing, information display and management, logistics, branding, graphics and packaging enables us to impact a wide array of markets—from consumer packaged goods and apparel to transportation, architecture and healthcare.

We strive to make each customer's brand more inspiring and every process more intelligent.

Avery Dennison's extensive experience in our core businesses allows us to purchase, process, and deliver needed materials to key points in our customers' supply chains with rapid and globally consistent execution.

In the 21st century, the company will expand its footprint in emerging markets.

The pursuit of this vision has compelled us to align our businesses into a focused, customer-driven company that specializes in materials science. Our in-depth pool of expertise and global scale enable us to deliver insights, innovative products and intelligent solutions to customers all over the world. – less",Technical Copywriter,$64K-$97K,Technical writing Documentation User manuals Technical specifications Industry-specific terminology Research skills,Botswana,213098,Gaborone

The holding company distributes electricity to 2.4 million customers and natural gas to 900,000 customers in Missouri and Illinois through utility subsidiaries. Ameren has a generating capacity of 16,000 MW (primarily coal-fired), most of which is controlled by utility Union Electric (which does business as Ameren Missouri) and nonregulated subsidiary AmerenEnergy Resources Generating Company. Ameren, which also supplies merchant generation power to third parties, operates a nuclear power facility, three hydroelectric plants, and several coal-fired plants and turbine combustion facilities. It also purchases power, including windpower.

Operations

In addition to operating power plants, Ameren procures natural gas for its affiliated companies, builds new power plants, and provides long-term energy supply contracts. It also markets and trades electricity to wholesale and retail customers and provides risk management and other energy-related services.

Financial Analysis

Ameren's overall revenues dipped in 2011. While increased rates helped to lift Ameren Missouri's revenues in 2011, Ameren Illinois' regulated segment and the merchant generation segment both reported a drop in revenues. In particular, low gas prices and a warm winter hurt gas revenues. However, lower purchased power and resale gas, coupled with a drop in goodwill, impairment, and other charges, helped to lift Ameren's net income for the year.

Favorable weather conditions (which increased energy demand) and rate increases help to lift the company's revenues in 2010. However, impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets in the merchant generation segment (due to the sustained decline in market prices for electricity) dragged down Ameren's operating income.

Strategy

In 2010 the company combined AmerenIP, AmerenCIPS, and AmerenCILCO into one entity, Ameren Illinois, in order to streamline operations and reduce confusion among customers. The three Illinois utilities have operated as a single business since 2004 and deliver energy to more than 1,100 communities. Ameren Illinois also operates some 21,400 miles of natural gas distribution and transmission lines.

To comply with federal requirements to separate ownership of power generation and transmission businesses, the operations of Ameren subsidiaries' transmission assets are under the control ofMidwest Independent Transmission System Operator, a regional transmission organization that coordinates power across 15 Midwestern states and one Canadian Province.  – less",Art Curator,$60K-$129K,Art history and knowledge Art curation and exhibition planning Collections management Art market trends Cultural awareness,Philippines,100637,Manila

Geographic Reach

Auto-Owners operates 85 claims, underwriting, and marketing offices in its 26-state service territory. The company's largest markets are Florida and Michigan.

Operations

Auto-Owners' revenues come from insurance premiums, as well as investment income. The company's property/casualty business accounts for about 90% of revenues and 80% of profits, with the remainder coming from premiums and income from the life insurance segment.

Financial Analysis

Auto-Owners reported a 5% increase in net written premiums in 2011 to nearly $5.2 billion, primarily due to growth within the Auto-Owners Insurance, Auto-Owners Life, and Home-Owners Insurance divisions. Total revenues were some $5.7 billion, while net income was reported at $69 million.

Strategy

Auto-Owners is focused on growing its business by establishing strong relationships with independent agents and by diversifying its product offerings.

The company's primary operations include the manufacture of building block chemicals like acetic acid and vinyl acetate monomers. Those chemicals are used in everything from inks and paints to agricultural products and chewing gum. Canadian subsidiary Acetex, the majority of whose sales come from Europe, is the world's largest acetyls manufacturer. Other products include acetate tow (in cigarette filters); industrial specialties like ethylene vinyl aceta; and engineered plastics. The bulk of sales come from the US and Germany. 

Operations

Celanese operates through four business segments: Advanced Engineered Materials, Consumer Specialties, Industrial Specialties, and Acetyl Intermediates. The company is one of the world's largest producers of acetyl products, as well as a top global producer of engineered polymers.

Geographic Reach

In addition to manufacturing sites in the US, it also has properties, plants, and equipment in Belgium, China, Canada, Germany, Mexico, and Singapore.

Financial Analysis

Celanese continued its recovery from the recession of 2008-09 with a 14% increase in revenues in 2011, due primarily to higher volumes and increased sales prices across most of its business segments. The largest gains were in its Industrial Specialties unit (up 18%), Advanced Engineered Materials unit (up 17%), and its Acetyl Intermediates segment (up 15%). Net income grew by 61% in 2011, as increased revenues outpaced a more modest growth in operating expenses.

Strategy

Celanese's strategy is to grow the company through expansion into emerging regions, particularly China; to offer innovation through developing new products and applications; increase its productivity through energy reduction, business process improvements, and manufacturing optimization; and boost its portfolio by growing its business through both acquisitions or internal growth.

In 2012 the company teamed up with Indonesia's Pertamina, forming a joint venture to develop fuel ethanol projects in that country.

To grow its emulsion polymers business, in 2011 the company acquired two product lines, Vinac and Flexbond, from Ashland. The acquisition is expected to speed up growth of the company's emulsion polymers operations throughout the Americas -- especially in the adhesives, textiles, coatings, and paper segments.

Celanese subsidiary Ticona Engineering Polymers acquired two product lines, Zenite liquid crystal polymer and Thermx polycyclohexylene-dimethylene terephthalate, from DuPont Performance Polymers division in 2010. The units expanded Celanese's offerings in the electrical and electronics application segments of the global polymers market. 

Ownership

In 2012 Capital Research Global Investors owned about 11% of Celanese, with several other investment firms owning a smaller stakes.

Company Background

Celanese Corporation was created in 2004 by the Blackstone Group, which had acquired a majority share in Celanese AG, turned it private, and then flipped it in a 2005 public offering. Blackstone finally divested its remaining holdings in Celanese in 2007. – less",Industrial Designer,$63K-$92K,Industrial design principles CAD and 3D modeling Prototyping and testing,Nicaragua,80231,Managua

It's the #3 broadline foodservice distributor in the US (behind SYSCO and U.S. Foodservice). Through its Foodservice division, PFG supplies more than 68,000 products to independent restaurants, hotels, other hospitality operators, and healthcare facilities through some 20 distribution facilities. The PFG Customized distribution unit serves chain restaurants such as Cracker Barrel and Ruby Tuesday. PFG subsidiary Vistar is a distributor of candy, snacks, and convenience foods for vending operators, retailers, and concessions. The company is owned by The Blackstone Group and Wellspring Capital Management, which took the business private in 2008.

Operations

With the $1.3 billion buyout in 2008 PFG was merged with Colorado-based Vistar (which was already controlled by Blackstone) to create a giant in the foodservice distribution industry with tentacles reaching into several markets. The combined business continues to operate under the PFG name, although each unit maintains its own headquarters. Across the company's foodservice, Vistar, and customized distribution businesses PFG collectively delivers more than 98,000 national- and proprietary-branded food and food-related products to more than 128,000 customers. As part of its operations, PFG maintains about 70 distribution centers and more than a dozen Merchant's Mart locations in the US.

Strategy

For PFG's broadline Performance Foodservice division, the focus has been on building the range of products it distributes to existing customers while improving margins. The division's more than 41,000 customers, located in about 40 countries, include franchisees of such chains as Burger King, Popeyes (owned by AFC Enterprises), and Subway. It also serves contract foodservice operators, such as Compass Group North America.

Mergers and Acquisitions

The company moved to expand its broadline division in mid-2012 by acquiring Carolina-based rival Institution Food House from Alex Lee. It also entered into an agreement in late 2012 to buy independent broadline foodservice distributor Fox River Foods, which serves seven states primarily in the Upper Midwestern region. The deals followed PFG's purchase in 2010 of Ledyard Company, which serves central and northern California. To add breadth to its product offering at its New England and Ohio offices, PFG in 2010 bought out the assets of VME Distributors. The wholesale supplier catered to mobile caterers, office coffee services, schools, prisons, and vending operators that do business in New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. – less",Customer Success Manager,$59K-$81K,Customer relationship management Onboarding and training Customer feedback analysis Retention strategies Cross-selling and upselling Strong communication and empathy Customer advocacy,Argentina,295587,Buenos Aires

The utility has a net generating capacity of about 19,200 MW from interests in fossil-fueled, nuclear, and hydroelectric power plants. Duke Energy Carolinas also sells power to wholesale customers.

The utility's three nuclear plants account for more than a quarter of Duke Energy Carolinas' generating capacity.

Duke Energy Carolinas is investing $7 billion from 2010 to 2012 to expand its generating capacity and maintain its nuclear fuel and plants. By 2020 the company is looking to expand capacity by 5,400 MW, a strategy that brings new plants online while replacing older, less efficient ones.

The global recession produced weaker demand for power (especially from industrial customers) which lowered company revenues in 2009. However, the same downturn cut fuel expenses (including purchased power from third parties) resulting in only a slight dip in Duke Energy Carolinas' operating income.

In 2010 the company saw its revenues rise, primarily due to new retail electric base rates in North Carolina and South Carolina, and favorable weather conditions which spurred demand. Duke Energy Carolinas also posted higher net income, despite an increase in fuel costs and expenses related to an employee voluntary severance plan. – less",Art Education Coordinator,$62K-$121K,Art education curriculum Program development Teacher training Communication skills Artistic expertise,Oman,4319,Muscat

The company's primary operations include the manufacture of building block chemicals like acetic acid and vinyl acetate monomers. Those chemicals are used in everything from inks and paints to agricultural products and chewing gum. Canadian subsidiary Acetex, the majority of whose sales come from Europe, is the world's largest acetyls manufacturer. Other products include acetate tow (in cigarette filters); industrial specialties like ethylene vinyl aceta; and engineered plastics. The bulk of sales come from the US and Germany. 

Operations

Celanese operates through four business segments: Advanced Engineered Materials, Consumer Specialties, Industrial Specialties, and Acetyl Intermediates. The company is one of the world's largest producers of acetyl products, as well as a top global producer of engineered polymers.

Geographic Reach

In addition to manufacturing sites in the US, it also has properties, plants, and equipment in Belgium, China, Canada, Germany, Mexico, and Singapore.

Financial Analysis

Celanese continued its recovery from the recession of 2008-09 with a 14% increase in revenues in 2011, due primarily to higher volumes and increased sales prices across most of its business segments. The largest gains were in its Industrial Specialties unit (up 18%), Advanced Engineered Materials unit (up 17%), and its Acetyl Intermediates segment (up 15%). Net income grew by 61% in 2011, as increased revenues outpaced a more modest growth in operating expenses.

Strategy

Celanese's strategy is to grow the company through expansion into emerging regions, particularly China; to offer innovation through developing new products and applications; increase its productivity through energy reduction, business process improvements, and manufacturing optimization; and boost its portfolio by growing its business through both acquisitions or internal growth.

In 2012 the company teamed up with Indonesia's Pertamina, forming a joint venture to develop fuel ethanol projects in that country.

To grow its emulsion polymers business, in 2011 the company acquired two product lines, Vinac and Flexbond, from Ashland. The acquisition is expected to speed up growth of the company's emulsion polymers operations throughout the Americas -- especially in the adhesives, textiles, coatings, and paper segments.

Celanese subsidiary Ticona Engineering Polymers acquired two product lines, Zenite liquid crystal polymer and Thermx polycyclohexylene-dimethylene terephthalate, from DuPont Performance Polymers division in 2010. The units expanded Celanese's offerings in the electrical and electronics application segments of the global polymers market. 

Ownership

In 2012 Capital Research Global Investors owned about 11% of Celanese, with several other investment firms owning a smaller stakes.

Company Background

Celanese Corporation was created in 2004 by the Blackstone Group, which had acquired a majority share in Celanese AG, turned it private, and then flipped it in a 2005 public offering. Blackstone finally divested its remaining holdings in Celanese in 2007. – less",Logistics Manager,$60K-$97K,Supply chain management Inventory control Transportation logistics Vendor relations Team leadership and management,Guyana,80446,Georgetown

Bruton Smith has raced Sonic Automotive to the front of the pack of US auto dealers behind larger rivals, such as AutoNation and Penske Automotive. Founded with five dealerships in 1997, Sonic today owns about 120 new- and used-vehicle dealerships and about 25 collision repair centers in major markets in 15 states, including Texas, the Carolinas, Tennessee and Georgia. The company sells some 30 brands of cars and light trucks and offers vehicle financing. Chairman Smith, who runs Sonic Automotive with his son Scott, is also the majority owner of Speedway Motorsports, which operates more than half a dozen NASCAR auto racetracks.

Financial Analysis

Overall, the company's revenues in 2011 accounted for some $7.8 billion versus around $3.6 billion in 2010. Net income came in at $77.6 million in 2011 compared to $95.9 million in 2010, a 15% decrease. In 2011 the impact of earthquakes and the tsunami that struck Japan disrupted the company's Japanese supply chain and vehicle production. Sonic's new vehicle revenues and gross margins were impacted, thus affecting net income. Sonics' new vehicle sales generated around $4.3 million (about 55% of revenues) in revenues in 2011; used vehicle sales accounted for some $2 million (around 25% of revenues), and the company's parts, service and collision segment accounted for around $1.2 million (some 15% of revenues) in revenues.

Operations

In 2011 the company sold approximately 12.7 million new vehicles compared to 11.6 million vehicles sold in 2010, a year-over-year increase of some 10%. The company sells new vehicles, including luxury (BMW, Lexus, Land Rover, and Volvo), mid-line import (Honda, Nissan, and Toyota), and domestic brands (Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors). Its luxury brands generated some 50% of revenues in 2011; while the company's mid-line and domestic brands accounted for about 35% and 15%, respectively.

Strategy

As part of the company's strategic plans, Sonic is primarily focused in growing its operations in metropolitan markets in the Southeast, Southwest, Midwest, and the West (California). The company's long-term growth strategy is to target luxury or mid-line import brands.

A part of top US power firm Duke Energy, the regulated utility provides electricity services to about 2.4 million customers in North and South Carolina. Operating in a 24,000-square mile service territory, Duke Energy Carolinas has 101,400 miles of distribution cable. Its transmission system spans 13,100 miles. The utility has a net generating capacity of about 19,200 MW from interests in fossil-fueled, nuclear, and hydroelectric power plants. Duke Energy Carolinas also sells power to wholesale customers.

The utility's three nuclear plants account for more than a quarter of Duke Energy Carolinas' generating capacity.

Duke Energy Carolinas is investing $7 billion from 2010 to 2012 to expand its generating capacity and maintain its nuclear fuel and plants. By 2020 the company is looking to expand capacity by 5,400 MW, a strategy that brings new plants online while replacing older, less efficient ones.

The global recession produced weaker demand for power (especially from industrial customers) which lowered company revenues in 2009. However, the same downturn cut fuel expenses (including purchased power from third parties) resulting in only a slight dip in Duke Energy Carolinas' operating income.

In 2010 the company saw its revenues rise, primarily due to new retail electric base rates in North Carolina and South Carolina, and favorable weather conditions which spurred demand. Duke Energy Carolinas also posted higher net income, despite an increase in fuel costs and expenses related to an employee voluntary severance plan. – less",Network Engineer,$59K-$119K,"Network infrastructure design Routing and switching Network protocols (e.g., TCP/IP) Cisco or Juniper certifications Troubleshooting and diagnostics Security protocols Wireless networking Network monitoring Collaboration Problem-solving Attention to detail",Dominican Republic,4468,Santo Domingo

The holding company distributes electricity to 2.4 million customers and natural gas to 900,000 customers in Missouri and Illinois through utility subsidiaries. Ameren has a generating capacity of 16,000 MW (primarily coal-fired), most of which is controlled by utility Union Electric (which does business as Ameren Missouri) and nonregulated subsidiary AmerenEnergy Resources Generating Company. Ameren, which also supplies merchant generation power to third parties, operates a nuclear power facility, three hydroelectric plants, and several coal-fired plants and turbine combustion facilities. It also purchases power, including windpower.

Operations

In addition to operating power plants, Ameren procures natural gas for its affiliated companies, builds new power plants, and provides long-term energy supply contracts. It also markets and trades electricity to wholesale and retail customers and provides risk management and other energy-related services.

Financial Analysis

Ameren's overall revenues dipped in 2011. While increased rates helped to lift Ameren Missouri's revenues in 2011, Ameren Illinois' regulated segment and the merchant generation segment both reported a drop in revenues. In particular, low gas prices and a warm winter hurt gas revenues. However, lower purchased power and resale gas, coupled with a drop in goodwill, impairment, and other charges, helped to lift Ameren's net income for the year.

Favorable weather conditions (which increased energy demand) and rate increases help to lift the company's revenues in 2010. However, impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets in the merchant generation segment (due to the sustained decline in market prices for electricity) dragged down Ameren's operating income.

Strategy

In 2010 the company combined AmerenIP, AmerenCIPS, and AmerenCILCO into one entity, Ameren Illinois, in order to streamline operations and reduce confusion among customers. The three Illinois utilities have operated as a single business since 2004 and deliver energy to more than 1,100 communities. Ameren Illinois also operates some 21,400 miles of natural gas distribution and transmission lines.

To comply with federal requirements to separate ownership of power generation and transmission businesses, the operations of Ameren subsidiaries' transmission assets are under the control ofMidwest Independent Transmission System Operator, a regional transmission organization that coordinates power across 15 Midwestern states and one Canadian Province.  – less",QA Manager,$55K-$89K,Quality assurance Process improvement Team leadership Problem-solving Quality control,Gabon,100745,Libreville

The bank is primarily active in the UK, where it has some 1,700 branches, but also has significant retail and commercial operations in Europe, Africa (it owns more than half of South African bank Absa Group), the Middle East, and the US. Barclays Bank offers standard retail services such as deposit accounts and lending, including Woolwich-brand mortgages. The bank also provides commercial money transfer services, insurance products, the Barclaycard line of credit cards, and financial advisory services. Barclays Bank traces its roots to the late 17th century.

Barclays Bank has been building up its portfolio of global credit card accounts, especially as other financial groups sell off noncore units during the economic recovery. In 2010 the company acquired the Italian credit card accounts of Citigroup in a deal that included some 197,000 card accounts and approximately €234 million ($320 million) worth of assets. It previously bought Goldfish, the struggling UK credit card unit of Discover Financial Services, for some £46 million ($70 million). In 2011 Barclays acquired Egg UK's credit card portfolio, which added more than 1 million accounts; it has agreed to buy more Citibank card accounts.

The bank has also been offloading some of its own holdings as part of an overall corporate restructuring. In 2010 Barclays sold its US subprime loan servicing business, HomEq Servicing, to Ocwen Financial. It also announced plans to abandon retail banking in certain international markets and instead focus on wholesale and commercial banking. In 2011 it shuttered its Indonesian retail unit Bank Akita, which it had acquired only two years before. The company also sold its Russian retail and commercial operations to a group of investors, citing difficulties competing in the market. Barclays will instead focus on its investment banking activities in the region.

In 2010 Barclays acquired Standard Life Bank from Standard Life for £226 million ($369 million). The deal added Standard Life's savings and mortgage books to the Barclays fold. Also as part of the deal, Barclays and Standard Life entered into a partnership whereby Barclays markets pension products to its clients.

Despite challenges in the economy, especially in regards to Europe's debt problems, Barclays Bank's revenues grew 8% in 2011. Its Africa business performed relatively strongly, with credit impairments improving, as did Barclaycard, thanks to the portfolio acquisitions which delivered profits. That year the bank closed nearly 150 European branches (largely located in Spain), the costs of which contributed to a 5% decline in net income. – less",Data Engineer,$62K-$94K,"Data integration ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Big data technologies (e.g., Hadoop, Spark) Database management Data warehousing",Guyana,234828,Georgetown

As the primary operating subsidiary of Pacific Mutual Holding Company, Pacific Life offers a wide range of life insurance, asset management, and financial services products, including individual annuities and mutual funds. It also offers a variety of investment products and services for individuals, businesses, and pension plans. Subsidiary Pacific Life & Annuity offers the same mix of life insurance and investment products and services for individuals and businesses in New York. Pacific Life was founded in 1868.

Operations

Pacific Life policyholders are members of parent Pacific Mutual Holding Company, which was created in 1997 following a conversion to the mutual holding company structure. Pacific LifeCorp is the intermediate stock holding company.

While life insurance is the company's bread and butter, it has brought in other operations for variety. Pacific Life's Aviation Capital Group subsidiary leases commercial jets to 90 airlines in more than 40 countries. It also manages aircraft assets for third parties such as commercial airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and financial institutions. Other subsidiaries include Pacific Asset Management, which provides third-party institutional asset management.

Sales & Marketing

Pacific Life's insurance policies are sold through independent distributors and through dealer/broker subsidiary Pacific Select Distributors.

Financial Analysis

The company's growth strategies helped Pacific Life achieve strong results in 2011, with revenues increasing 15% over 2010 to almost 6.7 billion, and net income increasing 29% to $679 million. Its operating income climbed a whopping 40% over 2010 to reach $823 million. The gains achieved were attributed to enhanced service offerings, expanded life insurance, annuity, and mutual fund product offerings, and the two acquisitions made that year.

Strategy

Being a mutual company, Pacific Life operates with a long-term focus to serve in the best interests of its policyholders and clients. in doing so, the company navigated the chilly economic waters of the 2008-2009 recession by steadily introducing new products and building up its capital reserves. By 2010 its net income had grown as risk-weary customers squirreled more of their savings and retirement monies into life insurance and mutual funds.

Mergers, Acquisitions & Divestitures

In 2008 the company added international reinsurance to its portfolio when it acquired the former London-based specialty reinsurance operations of Scottish Re and renamed the business as Pacific Life Re. It then added life retrocession (reinsurance of a reinsurer) to its line-up in 2011 by acquiring that business from Manulife and expanded its business to include the Toronto, Boston, Barbados, and Cologne markets.

Also in 2011 Pacific life bought JPMorgan Chase's pension risk advisory business to form Pacific Global Advisors. The unit offers risk management solutions and advisory services to pension plan sponsors.

The firm divested a noncore business, College Savings Bank, in 2012 to a syndicate of investors for an undisclosed price. The banking unit managed two state-sponsored 529 college savings plans. – less",Event Coordinator,$60K-$100K,Event planning Vendor coordination Budget management Marketing and promotion Logistics,Bolivia,179788,Sucre (de jure)

Western Digital,"{'Work Happiness Score': '69', 'Achievement': '79', 'Appreciation': '74', 'Flexibility': '74', 'Learning': '73', 'Purpose': '71', 'Trust': '69', 'Compensation': '69', 'Support': '69', 'Inclusion': '68', 'Energy': '67', 'Belonging': '66', 'Management': '65'}",3.8,"When it comes to data storage, Western Digital has drive. The company is one of the largest independent makers of hard-disk drives, which record, store, and recall volumes of data. Drives for PCs account for most of Western Digital's sales, although the company also makes devices used in servers, cloud computing data centers, and home entertainment products such as set-top boxes and video game consoles. The company sells to manufacturers and through retailers and distributors. More than 60% of its sales are to OEMs such as  Hewlett-Packard, which is Western Digital's largest customer. The company gets more than half of its sales from the Asia/Pacific region.

Operations

Western Digital is structured around two subsidiaries: WD Technologies and Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST). Each subsidiary maintains its own brand and product lines, with separate sales, marketing, operations, and product development teams. The company is looking to offer improved customer experiences for competing and complementary brands, while finding efficiencies in shared services.

Geographic Reach

The company is seeing strong growth in Asia (which represents more than 55% of sales) and the US (nearly 20%), with slower growth in the EMEA region (another nearly 20%). Western Digital has manufacturing facilities in the US and across Asia and sales offices worldwide.

Strategy

Western Digital is one of a handful of manufacturers that dominate the hard-disk drive market -- a sector characterized by harsh competition, short product life cycles, and aggressive price cuts. In order to reduce its dependence on drives for PCs, the company has branched into branded consumer media devices, including DVR expanders, portable media drives, and media players that let users play data from external drives on TV. Its WD TV Live Plus media player streams movies (including those offered by Netflix) and Internet video to a digital TV. It is also investing in products for the mobile computing and cloud computing markets.

Another promising market for Western Digital is nearline hard drives, which are more cost effective than traditional hard drives by providing more capacity while requiring lower power. Nearline hard drives are used for stimulated applications, such as video surveillance and medical imaging, and IT infrastructure applications, including scientific computing and Web search engines.

Mergers & Acquisitions

In 2012 Western Digital bought Hitachi's disk drive business, HGST, for around $4.3 billion in cash and stock. The deal boosts Western Digital's share of the global market to nearly 50%, ahead of rival Seagate Technology which accounts for around 30% of global shipments. Strategically, the deal adds disk drives used with servers -- a large part of both Hitachi and Seagate's businesses -- and gives Western Digital a better foothold in solid-state drives used in tablets and other portable devices. The acquisition also provides Western Digital its first manufacturing foothold in China and the Philippines. With the stock portion of the sale, Hitachi gains a 10% stake in Western Digital and two spots on the board of directors.

Western Digital has long used acquisitions to add new product lines and extend its geographic reach. Over the past several years it bought the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya for about $233 million and entered the market for solid-state drives with the $65 million purchase of SiliconSystems. In a large 2007 acquisition, Western Digital bought disk component maker Komag for $1 billion, which gave it the ability to manufacture the media and substrates used in its drives.

Financial Analysis

Western Digital's sales have fluctuated in recent years as it has dealt with the worldwide economic downturn. However, its acquisition of HGST helped produce strong results for fiscal 2012 (ended June 30). The company's revenues grew 31% that year to $12.5 billion, with HGST contributing more than $3 billion of that. It also saw an improvement in hard drive average selling price from $45 in fiscal 2011 to $62 in fiscal 2012.

Although Western Digital saw increased R&D and SG&A expenses in 2012, the overall strength of revenues led to a 122% jump in net income (to $1.6 billion). – less",Performance Testing Specialist,$62K-$98K,Performance testing Load testing Stress testing Test scenarios Performance monitoring Benchmarking Performance analysis,Aruba,43681,Oranjestad

The utility holding company distributes electricity to 3.4 million customers and natural gas to 1.9 million in eight states through four regulated utilities; Colorado and Minnesota account for most of its customers. Its utilities -- Northern States Power (NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin), Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service (in New Mexico and Texas) -- have the combined capacity of more than 17,150 MW of electricity. Xcel owns transmission and distribution lines, as well as natural gas assets. It is also the top wind power provider in the US, with wind farms in Colorado, Minnesota, and Texas.

Geographic Reach

The company serves customers in Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin.

 

Operations

Xcel operates power and gas utilities: Northern States Power, Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service. The holding company has more than 80 generating plants, more than 87,750 miles of transmission lines and about 191,840 miles of distribution lines. It also operates an interstate natural gas pipeline company and a joint venture to develop and lease natural gas pipelines, storage, and compression assets.

Financial Analysis

In 2011 Xcel reported a 3% jump in sales due to an increase in demand caused by a warmer-than-normal summer and a colder-than-normal winter. It was also assisted by a 3.7% increase in the electric segment due to cost recovery of the acquisition of the Rocky Mountain and Blue Spruce natural gas facilities by Public Service Company of Colorado and by natural gas retail rate increases in Minnesota.

Net income rose by 11% thanks to higher revenues and lower electric fuel and purchased power costs.

Higher rates and increased weather-related demand helped sales in 2010 to rise nearly 7%, going from $9.6 billion to about $10.3 billion. 

Strategy

Xcel is an energy company in transition, with long-term plans to move from coal-fired plants to natural gas, and on to alternative fuels such as wind, solar, and biomass to boost its green  power capacity (88,705 MWh by 2015).

In 2012 the company was seeking proposals for renewable resources other than wind or solar as part of its plan to diversify Southwestern Public Service Company  renewable energy portfolio.

As the largest US utility wind energy provider, Xcel controlled some 3,500 MW of wind energy in its portfolio in 2011 and plans to have 7,400 MW by 2020. In 2011 Xcel bought the 200 MW Limon Wind Energy Center, which will have 125 turbines in Lincoln and Elbert counties on Colorado's Front Range east of Denver. The company is also the US's fifth-largest utility solar energy provider and owns the fourth-largest transmission system. In addition, Xcel operates more than 25 hydroelectric power plants in Colorado, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.

The company believes its strategy of making environmentally sound investments is pivotal to its success. Among its 2010 projects were launching its 800-MW coal-fired unit in Colorado, known as Comanche 3, after installing advanced emission-reduction equipment. It also began construction of its CapX2020 project, a joint venture transmission expansion project with 10 other utilities, scheduled for completion by 2020. The project includes a 240-mile transmission line from Minnesota to North Dakota. The company has filed to extend the licensing plants of its two nuclear plants on Prairie Island in Minnesota for 20 years, which it expects to save customers more than $1 billion compared to alternative sources.

Xcel plans to construct one of the largest biomass generating plants in the Midwest. The facility, proposed for the Bay Front Generating Station in Ashland, Wisconsin, will generate power from burning wood waste in all three operating units by 2014. In 2011 Xcel had 73 MW of biomass generating power in Minnesota and Wisconsin.

Xcel is also working to develop so-called ""smart grid"" technology, which will provide customers with more reliability and control over their energy use. It has completed the nation's first fully integrated SmartGridCity in Boulder, Colorado.

In 2010 Xcel acquired two gas-fired power plants from Calpine Corporation for $739 million. The two Denver-area plants have a generating capacity of more than 900 MW and were already providing power to Public Service Company of Colorado under a contract agreement. The company is planning to acquire 775 MW of new wind-power capacity for its Colorado system over the next several years. – less",Creative Copywriter,$64K-$110K,Creative writing Copywriting Advertising copy Content creation Brand storytelling Marketing campaigns Proofreading and editing,Greenland,214121,Nuuk

The bank is primarily active in the UK, where it has some 1,700 branches, but also has significant retail and commercial operations in Europe, Africa (it owns more than half of South African bank Absa Group), the Middle East, and the US. Barclays Bank offers standard retail services such as deposit accounts and lending, including Woolwich-brand mortgages. The bank also provides commercial money transfer services, insurance products, the Barclaycard line of credit cards, and financial advisory services. Barclays Bank traces its roots to the late 17th century.

Barclays Bank has been building up its portfolio of global credit card accounts, especially as other financial groups sell off noncore units during the economic recovery. In 2010 the company acquired the Italian credit card accounts of Citigroup in a deal that included some 197,000 card accounts and approximately €234 million ($320 million) worth of assets. It previously bought Goldfish, the struggling UK credit card unit of Discover Financial Services, for some £46 million ($70 million). In 2011 Barclays acquired Egg UK's credit card portfolio, which added more than 1 million accounts; it has agreed to buy more Citibank card accounts.

The bank has also been offloading some of its own holdings as part of an overall corporate restructuring. In 2010 Barclays sold its US subprime loan servicing business, HomEq Servicing, to Ocwen Financial. It also announced plans to abandon retail banking in certain international markets and instead focus on wholesale and commercial banking. In 2011 it shuttered its Indonesian retail unit Bank Akita, which it had acquired only two years before. The company also sold its Russian retail and commercial operations to a group of investors, citing difficulties competing in the market. Barclays will instead focus on its investment banking activities in the region.

In 2010 Barclays acquired Standard Life Bank from Standard Life for £226 million ($369 million). The deal added Standard Life's savings and mortgage books to the Barclays fold. Also as part of the deal, Barclays and Standard Life entered into a partnership whereby Barclays markets pension products to its clients.

Despite challenges in the economy, especially in regards to Europe's debt problems, Barclays Bank's revenues grew 8% in 2011.

Founded with five dealerships in 1997, Sonic today owns about 120 new- and used-vehicle dealerships and about 25 collision repair centers in major markets in 15 states, including Texas, the Carolinas, Tennessee and Georgia. The company sells some 30 brands of cars and light trucks and offers vehicle financing. Chairman Smith, who runs Sonic Automotive with his son Scott, is also the majority owner of Speedway Motorsports, which operates more than half a dozen NASCAR auto racetracks.

Financial Analysis

Overall, the company's revenues in 2011 accounted for some $7.8 billion versus around $3.6 billion in 2010. Net income came in at $77.6 million in 2011 compared to $95.9 million in 2010, a 15% decrease. In 2011 the impact of earthquakes and the tsunami that struck Japan disrupted the company's Japanese supply chain and vehicle production. Sonic's new vehicle revenues and gross margins were impacted, thus affecting net income. Sonics' new vehicle sales generated around $4.3 million (about 55% of revenues) in revenues in 2011; used vehicle sales accounted for some $2 million (around 25% of revenues), and the company's parts, service and collision segment accounted for around $1.2 million (some 15% of revenues) in revenues.

Operations

In 2011 the company sold approximately 12.7 million new vehicles compared to 11.6 million vehicles sold in 2010, a year-over-year increase of some 10%. The company sells new vehicles, including luxury (BMW, Lexus, Land Rover, and Volvo), mid-line import (Honda, Nissan, and Toyota), and domestic brands (Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors). Its luxury brands generated some 50% of revenues in 2011; while the company's mid-line and domestic brands accounted for about 35% and 15%, respectively.

Strategy

As part of the company's strategic plans, Sonic is primarily focused in growing its operations in metropolitan markets in the Southeast, Southwest, Midwest, and the West (California). The company's long-term growth strategy is to target luxury or mid-line import brands.

Ownership

The Smiths control the company through their ownership of about 75% of Sonic Automotive's voting stock. – less",API Developer,$65K-$107K,"API design and development RESTful API knowledge Security protocols (OAuth, JWT)",Slovak Republic,61920,Bratislava

It also engages in natural gas compressing, treating, processing, transporting, and selling. DCP Midstream LLC also transports and sells NGLs and distributes propane wholesale. The company operates natural gas gathering systems (5,300 miles of pipe) in eight states (including Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas), seven processing plants, four NGL pipelines, and nine propane storage terminals. Spectra Energy holds a 50% holding in DCP (ConocoPhillips holds the other 50%).

A consolidator in the fragmented natural gas gathering, NGLs, and wholesale propane industry segments, the company has been expanding its gas supply base and its propane wholesale network in recent years through strategic complementary acquisitions and joint ventures.

In 2012 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Texas-based Crossroads processing plant and gathering system from Penn Virginia Resource Partners for $63 million. The bolt-on acquisition allows the company to expand its market position in East Texas and provide services to drillers in the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley regions.

In 2011 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Seaway Products Pipeline Co. from ConocoPhillips. The pipeline, now called Southern Hills Pipeline and being converted to NGL service, is expected to be operational by mid-2013. It will provide NGL access from the Midcontinent to the Texas Gulf Coast.

The company agreed to form a joint venture with EQT Corporation to develop natural gas processing and related natural gas liquid (NGL) infrastructure in the Marcellus and Huron shale plays in the Appalachian basin. (However, the parties could not come to agreement and dropped the plan in early 2011). In 2010, the company acquired the Liberty gathering system and south Raywood processing plant from Ceritas Energy in southeast Texas. The pipeline system interconnects with DCP Midstream's Centana Intrastate Pipeline system.

Expanding in Michigan, in 2009 the company acquired gas gathering and treating assets for $45.1 million. In 2010 it acquired a 350-mile interstate natural gas liquids pipeline system in Colorado's Denver-Julesburg Basin from Buckeye Partners for $22 million.

In 2010 DCP Midstream Partners moved to extend its Northeast wholesale propane business into the MidAtlantic region, acquiring UGI's Atlantic Energy for $49 million. That year it also purchased of NGL storage company Marysville Hydrocarbon Holdings (in Michigan) for about $95 million.

Although DCP Midstream Partners' revenues suffered in 2009 as a result of the global recession and lower commodity prices, acquisitions and organic growth managed to offset lower natural gas volumes.  Acquisitions, increased demand, higher commodity and propane prices, and gains on derivatives help to lift the company's revenues and net income in 2010.

In terms of the company's origins, the D in DCP Midstream Partners (formerly Duke Energy Field Services) is for Duke Energy; the CP, ConocoPhillips. These two energy majors formed DCP Midstream Partners in 2005. Following the spinoff of Spectra Energy from Duke Energy in 2007, Spectra Energy assumed Duke Energy's 50% holding in DCP. – less",Network Security Engineer,$65K-$118K,Network security protocols and technologies Firewalls and intrusion detection systems Vulnerability assessment and penetration testing Security policy development and enforcement Incident response and recovery,Bosnia and Herzegovina,25755,Sarajevo

Western Digital,"{'Work Happiness Score': '69', 'Achievement': '79', 'Appreciation': '74', 'Flexibility': '74', 'Learning': '73', 'Purpose': '71', 'Trust': '69', 'Compensation': '69', 'Support': '69', 'Inclusion': '68', 'Energy': '67', 'Belonging': '66', 'Management': '65'}",3.8,"When it comes to data storage, Western Digital has drive. The company is one of the largest independent makers of hard-disk drives, which record, store, and recall volumes of data. Drives for PCs account for most of Western Digital's sales, although the company also makes devices used in servers, cloud computing data centers, and home entertainment products such as set-top boxes and video game consoles. The company sells to manufacturers and through retailers and distributors. More than 60% of its sales are to OEMs such as  Hewlett-Packard, which is Western Digital's largest customer. The company gets more than half of its sales from the Asia/Pacific region.

Operations

Western Digital is structured around two subsidiaries: WD Technologies and Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST). Each subsidiary maintains its own brand and product lines, with separate sales, marketing, operations, and product development teams. The company is looking to offer improved customer experiences for competing and complementary brands, while finding efficiencies in shared services.

Geographic Reach

The company is seeing strong growth in Asia (which represents more than 55% of sales) and the US (nearly 20%), with slower growth in the EMEA region (another nearly 20%). Western Digital has manufacturing facilities in the US and across Asia and sales offices worldwide.

Strategy

Western Digital is one of a handful of manufacturers that dominate the hard-disk drive market -- a sector characterized by harsh competition, short product life cycles, and aggressive price cuts. In order to reduce its dependence on drives for PCs, the company has branched into branded consumer media devices, including DVR expanders, portable media drives, and media players that let users play data from external drives on TV. Its WD TV Live Plus media player streams movies (including those offered by Netflix) and Internet video to a digital TV. It is also investing in products for the mobile computing and cloud computing markets.

Another promising market for Western Digital is nearline hard drives, which are more cost effective than traditional hard drives by providing more capacity while requiring lower power. Nearline hard drives are used for stimulated applications, such as video surveillance and medical imaging, and IT infrastructure applications, including scientific computing and Web search engines.

Mergers & Acquisitions

In 2012 Western Digital bought Hitachi's disk drive business, HGST, for around $4.3 billion in cash and stock. The deal boosts Western Digital's share of the global market to nearly 50%, ahead of rival Seagate Technology which accounts for around 30% of global shipments. Strategically, the deal adds disk drives used with servers -- a large part of both Hitachi and Seagate's businesses -- and gives Western Digital a better foothold in solid-state drives used in tablets and other portable devices. The acquisition also provides Western Digital its first manufacturing foothold in China and the Philippines. With the stock portion of the sale, Hitachi gains a 10% stake in Western Digital and two spots on the board of directors.

Western Digital has long used acquisitions to add new product lines and extend its geographic reach. Over the past several years it bought the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya for about $233 million and entered the market for solid-state drives with the $65 million purchase of SiliconSystems. In a large 2007 acquisition, Western Digital bought disk component maker Komag for $1 billion, which gave it the ability to manufacture the media and substrates used in its drives.

Financial Analysis

Western Digital's sales have fluctuated in recent years as it has dealt with the worldwide economic downturn. However, its acquisition of HGST helped produce strong results for fiscal 2012 (ended June 30). The company's revenues grew 31% that year to $12.5 billion, with HGST contributing more than $3 billion of that. It also saw an improvement in hard drive average selling price from $45 in fiscal 2011 to $62 in fiscal 2012.

Although Western Digital saw increased R&D and SG&A expenses in 2012, the overall strength of revenues led to a 122% jump in net income (to $1.6 billion). – less",Supply Chain Coordinator,$62K-$114K,Supply chain logistics Inventory management Communication skills Problem-solving Vendor coordination,Trinidad and Tobago,44930,Port of Spain

As the primary operating subsidiary of Pacific Mutual Holding Company, Pacific Life offers a wide range of life insurance, asset management, and financial services products, including individual annuities and mutual funds. It also offers a variety of investment products and services for individuals, businesses, and pension plans. Subsidiary Pacific Life & Annuity offers the same mix of life insurance and investment products and services for individuals and businesses in New York. Pacific Life was founded in 1868.

Operations

Pacific Life policyholders are members of parent Pacific Mutual Holding Company, which was created in 1997 following a conversion to the mutual holding company structure. Pacific LifeCorp is the intermediate stock holding company.

While life insurance is the company's bread and butter, it has brought in other operations for variety. Pacific Life's Aviation Capital Group subsidiary leases commercial jets to 90 airlines in more than 40 countries. It also manages aircraft assets for third parties such as commercial airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and financial institutions. Other subsidiaries include Pacific Asset Management, which provides third-party institutional asset management.

Sales & Marketing

Pacific Life's insurance policies are sold through independent distributors and through dealer/broker subsidiary Pacific Select Distributors.

Financial Analysis

The company's growth strategies helped Pacific Life achieve strong results in 2011, with revenues increasing 15% over 2010 to almost 6.7 billion, and net income increasing 29% to $679 million. Its operating income climbed a whopping 40% over 2010 to reach $823 million. The gains achieved were attributed to enhanced service offerings, expanded life insurance, annuity, and mutual fund product offerings, and the two acquisitions made that year.

Strategy

Being a mutual company, Pacific Life operates with a long-term focus to serve in the best interests of its policyholders and clients. in doing so, the company navigated the chilly economic waters of the 2008-2009 recession by steadily introducing new products and building up its capital reserves. By 2010 its net income had grown as risk-weary customers squirreled more of their savings and retirement monies into life insurance and mutual funds.

Mergers, Acquisitions & Divestitures

In 2008 the company added international reinsurance to its portfolio when it acquired the former London-based specialty reinsurance operations of Scottish Re and renamed the business as Pacific Life Re. It then added life retrocession (reinsurance of a reinsurer) to its line-up in 2011 by acquiring that business from Manulife and expanded its business to include the Toronto, Boston, Barbados, and Cologne markets.

Also in 2011 Pacific life bought JPMorgan Chase's pension risk advisory business to form Pacific Global Advisors. The unit offers risk management solutions and advisory services to pension plan sponsors.

The firm divested a noncore business, College Savings Bank, in 2012 to a syndicate of investors for an undisclosed price.

Today, Asbury is one of the largest automotive retailers in the United States and one of the hottest.

Presently, the Asbury Automotive Group operates 31 automotive brands and 103 franchises in 9 states including Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Missouri, Texas and Virginia. Asbury is headquartered in Atlanta, GA.

Through its 10 individually-branded dealer groups, many of which are some of the most respected names in their markets, Asbury sells, finances and services a diverse range of foreign and domestic automotive brands. For the driven and ambitious, it presents a unique opportunity to get on the fast track to management growth, success and exponential financial gain.

You have the world of business in front of you, with one chance to make your mark. Before you decide which corner of the retail world you want to conquer, consider the following:

Total annual retail sales of automobiles in the U.S. are approximately $1 trillion - twice as large as the supermarket industry and 10 times larger than consumer electronics.

Asbury is a multi-billion dollar, publicly-traded company (NYSE:ABG) whose innovative management structure gives managers the flexibility to run day-to-day operations with the support and economies-of-scale of a larger corporate infrastructure. This promotes and rewards the entrepreneurial spirit as well as team accomplishment.

Asbury is capitalizing on a high proportion of luxury and midline import franchises and should generate above-average revenue growth. Our platform brands are leaders in their markets, and with incentivized management at every level, Asbury is primed for growth both organically and through acquisition

Western Digital,"{'Work Happiness Score': '69', 'Achievement': '79', 'Appreciation': '74', 'Flexibility': '74', 'Learning': '73', 'Purpose': '71', 'Trust': '69', 'Compensation': '69', 'Support': '69', 'Inclusion': '68', 'Energy': '67', 'Belonging': '66', 'Management': '65'}",3.8,"When it comes to data storage, Western Digital has drive. The company is one of the largest independent makers of hard-disk drives, which record, store, and recall volumes of data. Drives for PCs account for most of Western Digital's sales, although the company also makes devices used in servers, cloud computing data centers, and home entertainment products such as set-top boxes and video game consoles. The company sells to manufacturers and through retailers and distributors. More than 60% of its sales are to OEMs such as  Hewlett-Packard, which is Western Digital's largest customer. The company gets more than half of its sales from the Asia/Pacific region.

Operations

Western Digital is structured around two subsidiaries: WD Technologies and Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST). Each subsidiary maintains its own brand and product lines, with separate sales, marketing, operations, and product development teams. The company is looking to offer improved customer experiences for competing and complementary brands, while finding efficiencies in shared services.

Geographic Reach

The company is seeing strong growth in Asia (which represents more than 55% of sales) and the US (nearly 20%), with slower growth in the EMEA region (another nearly 20%). Western Digital has manufacturing facilities in the US and across Asia and sales offices worldwide.

Strategy

Western Digital is one of a handful of manufacturers that dominate the hard-disk drive market -- a sector characterized by harsh competition, short product life cycles, and aggressive price cuts. In order to reduce its dependence on drives for PCs, the company has branched into branded consumer media devices, including DVR expanders, portable media drives, and media players that let users play data from external drives on TV. Its WD TV Live Plus media player streams movies (including those offered by Netflix) and Internet video to a digital TV. It is also investing in products for the mobile computing and cloud computing markets.

Another promising market for Western Digital is nearline hard drives, which are more cost effective than traditional hard drives by providing more capacity while requiring lower power. Nearline hard drives are used for stimulated applications, such as video surveillance and medical imaging, and IT infrastructure applications, including scientific computing and Web search engines.

Mergers & Acquisitions

In 2012 Western Digital bought Hitachi's disk drive business, HGST, for around $4.3 billion in cash and stock. The deal boosts Western Digital's share of the global market to nearly 50%, ahead of rival Seagate Technology which accounts for around 30% of global shipments. Strategically, the deal adds disk drives used with servers -- a large part of both Hitachi and Seagate's businesses -- and gives Western Digital a better foothold in solid-state drives used in tablets and other portable devices. The acquisition also provides Western Digital its first manufacturing foothold in China and the Philippines. With the stock portion of the sale, Hitachi gains a 10% stake in Western Digital and two spots on the board of directors.

Western Digital has long used acquisitions to add new product lines and extend its geographic reach. Over the past several years it bought the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya for about $233 million and entered the market for solid-state drives with the $65 million purchase of SiliconSystems. In a large 2007 acquisition, Western Digital bought disk component maker Komag for $1 billion, which gave it the ability to manufacture the media and substrates used in its drives.

Financial Analysis

Western Digital's sales have fluctuated in recent years as it has dealt with the worldwide economic downturn. However, its acquisition of HGST helped produce strong results for fiscal 2012 (ended June 30).

It focuses on exploration and production assets in Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming, and western Canada. In 2011 Devon Energy reported proved reserves of 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent (58% natural gas) and more than 19,900 net acres of assets. It also drilled almost 2,500 gross wells. Devon Energy produces about 2.5 billion cu. ft. of natural gas a day (more than 3% of all the gas consumed in North America). The company is the largest producer and lease holder in the Barnett Shale (Texas) and is looking to replicate its success there to other unconventional plays.

Geographic Reach

Once active in major oil patches worldwide such as Azerbaijan, Brazil, and China, in the mid-2000s the company decided to focus on safer and increasingly productive unconventional onshore exploration opportunities (shales and oil sands) in North America. As a result, Devon Energy has sold all of its international assets.

Financial Analysis

Devon Energy posted a major improvement in revenues in 2010, thanks to higher commodity prices and an increase in production. In 2011, buoyed by record level reserves, high oil prices, and an increased demand for oil and gas products, the company posted a further 15% growth in revenues. Net income only rose by 3%, however, as higher operating, depreciation, deletion, and amortization costs and an increase in deferred income tax expense trimmed income growth.

Boosting its financial resources, in 2012 Devon Energy secured a commitment from Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration & Production for the Chinese company to invest $2.2 billion in exchange for one-third of Devon's interest in five new joint venture plays in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, Niobrara, Mississippian, Ohio Utica Shale, and the Michigan Basin.

That year it also closed a similar $1.4 billion joint venture deal with Sumitomo Corp. to develop 650,000 net acres in the Cline Shale and the Midland-Wolfcamp Shale in West Texas.

Strategy

In 2010 it sold most of its remaining international assets to BP for $7 billion. As part of this deal BP sold undeveloped oil sand leases in Canada to Devon Energy for $500 million and formed a joint venture with the company to exploit them. The company also sold its Panyu field, offshore China, to China National Offshore Oil for $515 million.

Consolidating its North American assets to just its onshore properties, In 2010 Devon Energy sold its stakes in the Cascade, Jack and St. Malo fields in the Gulf of Mexico (about 200 million barrels of estimated recoverable reserves) to AP Moller-Maersk's oil unit for $1.3 billion. It also sold its remaining Gulf of Mexico shelf assets to Apache for $1 billion. – less",Advertising Account Executive,$55K-$119K,Advertising and marketing knowledge Client relationship management Advertising campaign development Budget management Media planning and buying,Moldova,175969,Chisinau

Its operating income climbed a whopping 40% over 2010 to reach $823 million. The gains achieved were attributed to enhanced service offerings, expanded life insurance, annuity, and mutual fund product offerings, and the two acquisitions made that year.

Strategy

Being a mutual company, Pacific Life operates with a long-term focus to serve in the best interests of its policyholders and clients. in doing so, the company navigated the chilly economic waters of the 2008-2009 recession by steadily introducing new products and building up its capital reserves.

We are a leading, multi-category consumer goods company that provides tobacco and nicotine products to hundreds of millions of adult consumers worldwide.

For decades, we have built our business on successfully meeting the preferences of adult smokers with world-famous cigarette brands, superior blends and market-leading innovations.

We have been satisfying consumers, delivering shareholder value and creating valued employment for over a century. However, we are entering the most dynamic period of change our industry has ever encountered.

An unprecedented confluence of technology, societal change and public health awareness has created a unique opportunity: the opportunity to make a substantial leap forward in our long-held ambition to provide our consumers with potentially reduced-risk tobacco and nicotine choices.

Our acquisition of Reynolds American Inc. (RAI) in July 2017, which has transformed both the scale and geographic reach of our business and our portfolio of potentially reduced-risk products, now positions us perfectly to capitalise on this ambition.

We call this ambition Transforming Tobacco and we are fully committed to leading this transformation.


The way our people operate is embodied in our four Guiding Principles: Enterprising Spirit, Freedom Through Responsibility, Open Minded and Strength from Diversity. These principles underpin our culture and guide how we deliver our strategy.

The culture of the Group is about developing talent from within, stretching and supporting the high performing managers who will lead the delivery of our strategy. In 2017, over 92% of our senior appointments were drawn from people already within the business – moves that have helped deliver stronger and more diverse leadership teams.

Our employer brand – ‘Bring your Difference’ – has a strong presence across social media channels, including LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram. We are leading our industry in social media engagement and have moved ahead of several top FMCG companies.

Providing a safe place to work, protecting our employees’ wellbeing and listening to their views are also fundamental.

As the primary operating subsidiary of Pacific Mutual Holding Company, Pacific Life offers a wide range of life insurance, asset management, and financial services products, including individual annuities and mutual funds. It also offers a variety of investment products and services for individuals, businesses, and pension plans. Subsidiary Pacific Life & Annuity offers the same mix of life insurance and investment products and services for individuals and businesses in New York. Pacific Life was founded in 1868.

Operations

Pacific Life policyholders are members of parent Pacific Mutual Holding Company, which was created in 1997 following a conversion to the mutual holding company structure. Pacific LifeCorp is the intermediate stock holding company.

While life insurance is the company's bread and butter, it has brought in other operations for variety. Pacific Life's Aviation Capital Group subsidiary leases commercial jets to 90 airlines in more than 40 countries. It also manages aircraft assets for third parties such as commercial airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and financial institutions. Other subsidiaries include Pacific Asset Management, which provides third-party institutional asset management.

Sales & Marketing

Pacific Life's insurance policies are sold through independent distributors and through dealer/broker subsidiary Pacific Select Distributors.

Financial Analysis

The company's growth strategies helped Pacific Life achieve strong results in 2011, with revenues increasing 15% over 2010 to almost 6.7 billion, and net income increasing 29% to $679 million. Its operating income climbed a whopping 40% over 2010 to reach $823 million. The gains achieved were attributed to enhanced service offerings, expanded life insurance, annuity, and mutual fund product offerings, and the two acquisitions made that year.

Strategy

Being a mutual company, Pacific Life operates with a long-term focus to serve in the best interests of its policyholders and clients. in doing so, the company navigated the chilly economic waters of the 2008-2009 recession by steadily introducing new products and building up its capital reserves. By 2010 its net income had grown as risk-weary customers squirreled more of their savings and retirement monies into life insurance and mutual funds.

Mergers, Acquisitions & Divestitures

In 2008 the company added international reinsurance to its portfolio when it acquired the former London-based specialty reinsurance operations of Scottish Re and renamed the business as Pacific Life Re. It then added life retrocession (reinsurance of a reinsurer) to its line-up in 2011 by acquiring that business from Manulife and expanded its business to include the Toronto, Boston, Barbados, and Cologne markets.

Also in 2011 Pacific life bought JPMorgan Chase's pension risk advisory business to form Pacific Global Advisors. The unit offers risk management solutions and advisory services to pension plan sponsors.

The firm divested a noncore business, College Savings Bank, in 2012 to a syndicate of investors for an undisclosed price.

Through Ameriprise Financial, Columbia Management, RiverSource, and other affiliates and brands, the company provides access to insurance, mutual funds, savings plans, personal trust services, retail brokerage, and other financial products and services. Its Ameriprise Bank subsidiary offers deposits and loans. Ameriprise, which has about $630 billion of assets under management, distributes its products primarily through a network of more than 9,700 financial advisors.

The company has been sharpening its focus on its branded adviser network. It sold its Securities America independent broker-dealer subsidiary to Ladenburg Thalmann for some $150 million in 2011. Shortly before the sale of the troubled unit, Ameriprise agreed to pay $160 million to settle claims that Securities America brokers sold securities in fraudulent companies.

Ameriprise has been steadily boosting its assets under management and growing its client base (focusing on the affluent and mass affluent with at least $100,000 in investable assets). The company also is focused on geographic areas where those clients are congregated and has closed or consolidated offices in areas with less potential. While Columbia Management covers Ameriprise's main asset management market in the US, the company is increasing its global presence through its Threadneedle brand overseas. Ameriprise plans to grow its asset management operations in Europe, as well as in Australia, the Middle East, and Asia.

Ameriprise's strategies have paid off. Volatile financial market conditions, which negatively impacted all of the company's operations, led to a decline in revenue in 2008 and 2009. However, the company returned to success in 2010 and revenues grew by more than 20% that year. Poor economic conditions continued in 2011. However, Ameriprise's operating net revenues climbed that year by about 10%. The boost was due to strong growth in the company's fee-based advisory and asset management businesses.

The bank is primarily active in the UK, where it has some 1,700 branches, but also has significant retail and commercial operations in Europe, Africa (it owns more than half of South African bank Absa Group), the Middle East, and the US. Barclays Bank offers standard retail services such as deposit accounts and lending, including Woolwich-brand mortgages. The bank also provides commercial money transfer services, insurance products, the Barclaycard line of credit cards, and financial advisory services. Barclays Bank traces its roots to the late 17th century.

Barclays Bank has been building up its portfolio of global credit card accounts, especially as other financial groups sell off noncore units during the economic recovery. In 2010 the company acquired the Italian credit card accounts of Citigroup in a deal that included some 197,000 card accounts and approximately €234 million ($320 million) worth of assets. It previously bought Goldfish, the struggling UK credit card unit of Discover Financial Services, for some £46 million ($70 million). In 2011 Barclays acquired Egg UK's credit card portfolio, which added more than 1 million accounts; it has agreed to buy more Citibank card accounts.

The bank has also been offloading some of its own holdings as part of an overall corporate restructuring. In 2010 Barclays sold its US subprime loan servicing business, HomEq Servicing, to Ocwen Financial. It also announced plans to abandon retail banking in certain international markets and instead focus on wholesale and commercial banking. In 2011 it shuttered its Indonesian retail unit Bank Akita, which it had acquired only two years before. The company also sold its Russian retail and commercial operations to a group of investors, citing difficulties competing in the market. Barclays will instead focus on its investment banking activities in the region.

In 2010 Barclays acquired Standard Life Bank from Standard Life for £226 million ($369 million). The deal added Standard Life's savings and mortgage books to the Barclays fold. Also as part of the deal, Barclays and Standard Life entered into a partnership whereby Barclays markets pension products to its clients.

Despite challenges in the economy, especially in regards to Europe's debt problems, Barclays Bank's revenues grew 8% in 2011. Its Africa business performed relatively strongly, with credit impairments improving, as did Barclaycard, thanks to the portfolio acquisitions which delivered profits. That year the bank closed nearly 150 European branches (largely located in Spain), the costs of which contributed to a 5% decline in net income. – less",SEO Specialist,$55K-$106K,"Search engine algorithms and ranking factors Keyword research and analysis On-page and off-page SEO optimization SEO tools (e.g., Google Analytics, SEMrush) SEO content strategy",Tunisia,234606,Tunis

Financial Analysis

Auto-Owners reported a 5% increase in net written premiums in 2011 to nearly $5.2 billion, primarily due to growth within the Auto-Owners Insurance, Auto-Owners Life, and Home-Owners Insurance divisions. Total revenues were some $5.7 billion, while net income was reported at $69 million.

Founded with five dealerships in 1997, Sonic today owns about 120 new- and used-vehicle dealerships and about 25 collision repair centers in major markets in 15 states, including Texas, the Carolinas, Tennessee and Georgia. The company sells some 30 brands of cars and light trucks and offers vehicle financing. Chairman Smith, who runs Sonic Automotive with his son Scott, is also the majority owner of Speedway Motorsports, which operates more than half a dozen NASCAR auto racetracks.

Financial Analysis

Overall, the company's revenues in 2011 accounted for some $7.8 billion versus around $3.6 billion in 2010. Net income came in at $77.6 million in 2011 compared to $95.9 million in 2010, a 15% decrease. In 2011 the impact of earthquakes and the tsunami that struck Japan disrupted the company's Japanese supply chain and vehicle production. Sonic's new vehicle revenues and gross margins were impacted, thus affecting net income. Sonics' new vehicle sales generated around $4.3 million (about 55% of revenues) in revenues in 2011; used vehicle sales accounted for some $2 million (around 25% of revenues), and the company's parts, service and collision segment accounted for around $1.2 million (some 15% of revenues) in revenues.

Operations

In 2011 the company sold approximately 12.7 million new vehicles compared to 11.6 million vehicles sold in 2010, a year-over-year increase of some 10%.

Strategy

As part of the company's strategic plans, Sonic is primarily focused in growing its operations in metropolitan markets in the Southeast, Southwest, Midwest, and the West (California). The company's long-term growth strategy is to target luxury or mid-line import brands.

The bank is primarily active in the UK, where it has some 1,700 branches, but also has significant retail and commercial operations in Europe, Africa (it owns more than half of South African bank Absa Group), the Middle East, and the US. Barclays Bank offers standard retail services such as deposit accounts and lending, including Woolwich-brand mortgages. The bank also provides commercial money transfer services, insurance products, the Barclaycard line of credit cards, and financial advisory services. Barclays Bank traces its roots to the late 17th century.

Barclays Bank has been building up its portfolio of global credit card accounts, especially as other financial groups sell off noncore units during the economic recovery. In 2010 the company acquired the Italian credit card accounts of Citigroup in a deal that included some 197,000 card accounts and approximately €234 million ($320 million) worth of assets. It previously bought Goldfish, the struggling UK credit card unit of Discover Financial Services, for some £46 million ($70 million). In 2011 Barclays acquired Egg UK's credit card portfolio, which added more than 1 million accounts; it has agreed to buy more Citibank card accounts.

The bank has also been offloading some of its own holdings as part of an overall corporate restructuring. In 2010 Barclays sold its US subprime loan servicing business, HomEq Servicing, to Ocwen Financial. It also announced plans to abandon retail banking in certain international markets and instead focus on wholesale and commercial banking. In 2011 it shuttered its Indonesian retail unit Bank Akita, which it had acquired only two years before. The company also sold its Russian retail and commercial operations to a group of investors, citing difficulties competing in the market. Barclays will instead focus on its investment banking activities in the region.

In 2010 Barclays acquired Standard Life Bank from Standard Life for £226 million ($369 million). The deal added Standard Life's savings and mortgage books to the Barclays fold. Also as part of the deal, Barclays and Standard Life entered into a partnership whereby Barclays markets pension products to its clients.

Despite challenges in the economy, especially in regards to Europe's debt problems, Barclays Bank's revenues grew 8% in 2011. Its Africa business performed relatively strongly, with credit impairments improving, as did Barclaycard, thanks to the portfolio acquisitions which delivered profits. That year the bank closed nearly 150 European branches (largely located in Spain), the costs of which contributed to a 5% decline in net income. – less",Business Systems Analyst,$65K-$97K,Business systems analysis Requirements gathering Process improvement,Kuwait,234603,Kuwait City

A part of top US power firm Duke Energy, the regulated utility provides electricity services to about 2.4 million customers in North and South Carolina. Operating in a 24,000-square mile service territory, Duke Energy Carolinas has 101,400 miles of distribution cable. Its transmission system spans 13,100 miles. The utility has a net generating capacity of about 19,200 MW from interests in fossil-fueled, nuclear, and hydroelectric power plants. Duke Energy Carolinas also sells power to wholesale customers.

The utility's three nuclear plants account for more than a quarter of Duke Energy Carolinas' generating capacity.

Duke Energy Carolinas is investing $7 billion from 2010 to 2012 to expand its generating capacity and maintain its nuclear fuel and plants. By 2020 the company is looking to expand capacity by 5,400 MW, a strategy that brings new plants online while replacing older, less efficient ones.

The global recession produced weaker demand for power (especially from industrial customers) which lowered company revenues in 2009. However, the same downturn cut fuel expenses (including purchased power from third parties) resulting in only a slight dip in Duke Energy Carolinas' operating income.

In 2010 the company saw its revenues rise, primarily due to new retail electric base rates in North Carolina and South Carolina, and favorable weather conditions which spurred demand. Duke Energy Carolinas also posted higher net income, despite an increase in fuel costs and expenses related to an employee voluntary severance plan. – less",Strategic Sourcing Manager,$65K-$97K,Strategic sourcing strategies Supplier evaluation and selection Negotiation skills Vendor management Cost analysis Supply chain management Contract management Problem-solving Attention to detail Communication skills Strategic thinking,Chad,4030,N'Djamena

The company’s applications and technologies are an integral part of products used in every major market and industry.
With operations in more than 50 countries and 25,000 employees worldwide, Avery Dennison serves customers with insights and innovations that help make brands more inspiring and the world more intelligent.
Avery Dennison Corporation (NYSE: AVY) is a Fortune 500® company with sales of $6 billion from continuing operations in 2015. We are based in Glendale, California.

The Avery Dennison story begins in 1935, with just a few spare parts, one very bright idea and a $100 loan.

Ray Stanton (“Stan”) Avery, a struggling clerk in Los Angeles, invented a smarter way for stores to price their products, then went on to pioneer the labeling industry.

With a few simple materials—primarily used machine parts and a saber saw—Stan created and patented the first self-adhesive, die-cut labeling machine. His practical genius would ultimately yield eighteen patents and establish Avery Adhesives as the company that transformed how brands and businesses deliver information. In 1990, Avery International merged with Dennison Manufacturing to become Avery Dennison.

Today, we manufacture and distribute labeling and packaging materials in over 50 countries and employ more than 25,000 people. The flexibility and responsiveness afforded by our company's global footprint enables us to service our customers at key points throughout their supply chain.

In just over 80 years we have grown from one bright idea into a global corporation that continues to set new standards for quality and innovation in materials science.

Avery Dennison manufactures and distributes display graphics, labeling and packaging materials, retail graphic embellishments and RFID tags that companies around the world use to engage customers and efficiently manage their inventories. Our products are virtually everywhere you look, providing a crucial thread in the fabric of global commerce.

We sustain Stan Avery's spirit of curiosity through research, invention and development of new materials science products and processes. Our expertise in high-speed manufacturing, information display and management, logistics, branding, graphics and packaging enables us to impact a wide array of markets—from consumer packaged goods and apparel to transportation, architecture and healthcare.

We strive to make each customer's brand more inspiring and every process more intelligent.

Avery Dennison's extensive experience in our core businesses allows us to purchase, process, and deliver needed materials to key points in our customers' supply chains with rapid and globally consistent execution.

In the 21st century, the company will expand its footprint in emerging markets.

The pursuit of this vision has compelled us to align our businesses into a focused, customer-driven company that specializes in materials science. Our in-depth pool of expertise and global scale enable us to deliver insights, innovative products and intelligent solutions to customers all over the world. – less",Technical Copywriter,$57K-$104K,Technical writing Documentation User manuals Technical specifications Industry-specific terminology Research skills,France,212794,Paris

Bruton Smith has raced Sonic Automotive to the front of the pack of US auto dealers behind larger rivals, such as AutoNation and Penske Automotive. Founded with five dealerships in 1997, Sonic today owns about 120 new- and used-vehicle dealerships and about 25 collision repair centers in major markets in 15 states, including Texas, the Carolinas, Tennessee and Georgia. The company sells some 30 brands of cars and light trucks and offers vehicle financing. Chairman Smith, who runs Sonic Automotive with his son Scott, is also the majority owner of Speedway Motorsports, which operates more than half a dozen NASCAR auto racetracks.

Financial Analysis

Overall, the company's revenues in 2011 accounted for some $7.8 billion versus around $3.6 billion in 2010. Net income came in at $77.6 million in 2011 compared to $95.9 million in 2010, a 15% decrease. In 2011 the impact of earthquakes and the tsunami that struck Japan disrupted the company's Japanese supply chain and vehicle production. Sonic's new vehicle revenues and gross margins were impacted, thus affecting net income. Sonics' new vehicle sales generated around $4.3 million (about 55% of revenues) in revenues in 2011; used vehicle sales accounted for some $2 million (around 25% of revenues), and the company's parts, service and collision segment accounted for around $1.2 million (some 15% of revenues) in revenues.

Operations

In 2011 the company sold approximately 12.7 million new vehicles compared to 11.6 million vehicles sold in 2010, a year-over-year increase of some 10%. The company sells new vehicles, including luxury (BMW, Lexus, Land Rover, and Volvo), mid-line import (Honda, Nissan, and Toyota), and domestic brands (Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors). Its luxury brands generated some 50% of revenues in 2011; while the company's mid-line and domestic brands accounted for about 35% and 15%, respectively.

Strategy

As part of the company's strategic plans, Sonic is primarily focused in growing its operations in metropolitan markets in the Southeast, Southwest, Midwest, and the West (California). The company's long-term growth strategy is to target luxury or mid-line import brands.

Ownership

The Smiths control the company through their ownership of about 75% of Sonic Automotive's voting stock. – less",Industrial Engineer,$61K-$120K,Industrial engineering Process optimization Lean manufacturing Quality control Data analysis Workflow design,Democratic Republic Of Congo,62453,Kinshasa

It focuses on exploration and production assets in Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming, and western Canada. In 2011 Devon Energy reported proved reserves of 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent (58% natural gas) and more than 19,900 net acres of assets. It also drilled almost 2,500 gross wells. Devon Energy produces about 2.5 billion cu. ft. of natural gas a day (more than 3% of all the gas consumed in North America). The company is the largest producer and lease holder in the Barnett Shale (Texas) and is looking to replicate its success there to other unconventional plays.

Geographic Reach

Once active in major oil patches worldwide such as Azerbaijan, Brazil, and China, in the mid-2000s the company decided to focus on safer and increasingly productive unconventional onshore exploration opportunities (shales and oil sands) in North America. As a result, Devon Energy has sold all of its international assets.

Financial Analysis

Devon Energy posted a major improvement in revenues in 2010, thanks to higher commodity prices and an increase in production. In 2011, buoyed by record level reserves, high oil prices, and an increased demand for oil and gas products, the company posted a further 15% growth in revenues. Net income only rose by 3%, however, as higher operating, depreciation, deletion, and amortization costs and an increase in deferred income tax expense trimmed income growth.

Boosting its financial resources, in 2012 Devon Energy secured a commitment from Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration & Production for the Chinese company to invest $2.2 billion in exchange for one-third of Devon's interest in five new joint venture plays in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, Niobrara, Mississippian, Ohio Utica Shale, and the Michigan Basin.

That year it also closed a similar $1.4 billion joint venture deal with Sumitomo Corp. to develop 650,000 net acres in the Cline Shale and the Midland-Wolfcamp Shale in West Texas.

Strategy

In 2010 it sold most of its remaining international assets to BP for $7 billion. As part of this deal BP sold undeveloped oil sand leases in Canada to Devon Energy for $500 million and formed a joint venture with the company to exploit them. The company also sold its Panyu field, offshore China, to China National Offshore Oil for $515 million.

Consolidating its North American assets to just its onshore properties, In 2010 Devon Energy sold its stakes in the Cascade, Jack and St. Malo fields in the Gulf of Mexico (about 200 million barrels of estimated recoverable reserves) to AP Moller-Maersk's oil unit for $1.3 billion. It also sold its remaining Gulf of Mexico shelf assets to Apache for $1 billion. – less",Supply Chain Manager,$62K-$113K,Supply chain logistics and management Inventory control and procurement Supplier relationship management Data analysis and forecasting Risk assessment and mitigation,"Macao SAR, China",175399,Macao

Avery Dennison Corporation (NYSE: AVY) is a Fortune 500® company with sales of $6 billion from continuing operations in 2015. We are based in Glendale, California.

The Avery Dennison story begins in 1935, with just a few spare parts, one very bright idea and a $100 loan.

Ray Stanton (“Stan”) Avery, a struggling clerk in Los Angeles, invented a smarter way for stores to price their products, then went on to pioneer the labeling industry.

With a few simple materials—primarily used machine parts and a saber saw—Stan created and patented the first self-adhesive, die-cut labeling machine. His practical genius would ultimately yield eighteen patents and establish Avery Adhesives as the company that transformed how brands and businesses deliver information. In 1990, Avery International merged with Dennison Manufacturing to become Avery Dennison.

Today, we manufacture and distribute labeling and packaging materials in over 50 countries and employ more than 25,000 people. The flexibility and responsiveness afforded by our company's global footprint enables us to service our customers at key points throughout their supply chain.

In just over 80 years we have grown from one bright idea into a global corporation that continues to set new standards for quality and innovation in materials science.

Avery Dennison manufactures and distributes display graphics, labeling and packaging materials, retail graphic embellishments and RFID tags that companies around the world use to engage customers and efficiently manage their inventories. Our products are virtually everywhere you look, providing a crucial thread in the fabric of global commerce.

We sustain Stan Avery's spirit of curiosity through research, invention and development of new materials science products and processes. Our expertise in high-speed manufacturing, information display and management, logistics, branding, graphics and packaging enables us to impact a wide array of markets—from consumer packaged goods and apparel to transportation, architecture and healthcare.

We strive to make each customer's brand more inspiring and every process more intelligent.

Avery Dennison's extensive experience in our core businesses allows us to purchase, process, and deliver needed materials to key points in our customers' supply chains with rapid and globally consistent execution.

In the 21st century, the company will expand its footprint in emerging markets.

The pursuit of this vision has compelled us to align our businesses into a focused, customer-driven company that specializes in materials science.

The company operates natural gas gathering systems (5,300 miles of pipe) in eight states (including Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas), seven processing plants, four NGL pipelines, and nine propane storage terminals. Spectra Energy holds a 50% holding in DCP (ConocoPhillips holds the other 50%).

A consolidator in the fragmented natural gas gathering, NGLs, and wholesale propane industry segments, the company has been expanding its gas supply base and its propane wholesale network in recent years through strategic complementary acquisitions and joint ventures.

In 2012 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Texas-based Crossroads processing plant and gathering system from Penn Virginia Resource Partners for $63 million. The bolt-on acquisition allows the company to expand its market position in East Texas and provide services to drillers in the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley regions.

In 2011 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Seaway Products Pipeline Co. from ConocoPhillips. The pipeline, now called Southern Hills Pipeline and being converted to NGL service, is expected to be operational by mid-2013. It will provide NGL access from the Midcontinent to the Texas Gulf Coast.

The company agreed to form a joint venture with EQT Corporation to develop natural gas processing and related natural gas liquid (NGL) infrastructure in the Marcellus and Huron shale plays in the Appalachian basin. (However, the parties could not come to agreement and dropped the plan in early 2011). In 2010, the company acquired the Liberty gathering system and south Raywood processing plant from Ceritas Energy in southeast Texas. The pipeline system interconnects with DCP Midstream's Centana Intrastate Pipeline system.

Expanding in Michigan, in 2009 the company acquired gas gathering and treating assets for $45.1 million. In 2010 it acquired a 350-mile interstate natural gas liquids pipeline system in Colorado's Denver-Julesburg Basin from Buckeye Partners for $22 million.

In 2010 DCP Midstream Partners moved to extend its Northeast wholesale propane business into the MidAtlantic region, acquiring UGI's Atlantic Energy for $49 million. That year it also purchased of NGL storage company Marysville Hydrocarbon Holdings (in Michigan) for about $95 million.

Although DCP Midstream Partners' revenues suffered in 2009 as a result of the global recession and lower commodity prices, acquisitions and organic growth managed to offset lower natural gas volumes.  Acquisitions, increased demand, higher commodity and propane prices, and gains on derivatives help to lift the company's revenues and net income in 2010.

In terms of the company's origins, the D in DCP Midstream Partners (formerly Duke Energy Field Services) is for Duke Energy; the CP, ConocoPhillips. These two energy majors formed DCP Midstream Partners in 2005. Following the spinoff of Spectra Energy from Duke Energy in 2007, Spectra Energy assumed Duke Energy's 50% holding in DCP. – less",Pediatric Specialist,$58K-$94K,"Pediatric specialization Advanced pediatric care Pediatric subspecialty (e.g., pediatric cardiology, pediatric oncology) Pediatric diagnostics Pediatric treatment",Bosnia and Herzegovina,26725,Sarajevo

The utility holding company distributes electricity to 3.4 million customers and natural gas to 1.9 million in eight states through four regulated utilities; Colorado and Minnesota account for most of its customers. Its utilities -- Northern States Power (NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin), Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service (in New Mexico and Texas) -- have the combined capacity of more than 17,150 MW of electricity. Xcel owns transmission and distribution lines, as well as natural gas assets. It is also the top wind power provider in the US, with wind farms in Colorado, Minnesota, and Texas.

Geographic Reach

The company serves customers in Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin.

 

Operations

Xcel operates power and gas utilities: Northern States Power, Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service. The holding company has more than 80 generating plants, more than 87,750 miles of transmission lines and about 191,840 miles of distribution lines. It also operates an interstate natural gas pipeline company and a joint venture to develop and lease natural gas pipelines, storage, and compression assets.

Financial Analysis

In 2011 Xcel reported a 3% jump in sales due to an increase in demand caused by a warmer-than-normal summer and a colder-than-normal winter. It was also assisted by a 3.7% increase in the electric segment due to cost recovery of the acquisition of the Rocky Mountain and Blue Spruce natural gas facilities by Public Service Company of Colorado and by natural gas retail rate increases in Minnesota.

Net income rose by 11% thanks to higher revenues and lower electric fuel and purchased power costs.

Higher rates and increased weather-related demand helped sales in 2010 to rise nearly 7%, going from $9.6 billion to about $10.3 billion. 

Strategy

Xcel is an energy company in transition, with long-term plans to move from coal-fired plants to natural gas, and on to alternative fuels such as wind, solar, and biomass to boost its green  power capacity (88,705 MWh by 2015).

In 2012 the company was seeking proposals for renewable resources other than wind or solar as part of its plan to diversify Southwestern Public Service Company  renewable energy portfolio.

As the largest US utility wind energy provider, Xcel controlled some 3,500 MW of wind energy in its portfolio in 2011 and plans to have 7,400 MW by 2020. In 2011 Xcel bought the 200 MW Limon Wind Energy Center, which will have 125 turbines in Lincoln and Elbert counties on Colorado's Front Range east of Denver. The company is also the US's fifth-largest utility solar energy provider and owns the fourth-largest transmission system. In addition, Xcel operates more than 25 hydroelectric power plants in Colorado, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.

The company believes its strategy of making environmentally sound investments is pivotal to its success. Among its 2010 projects were launching its 800-MW coal-fired unit in Colorado, known as Comanche 3, after installing advanced emission-reduction equipment. It also began construction of its CapX2020 project, a joint venture transmission expansion project with 10 other utilities, scheduled for completion by 2020. The project includes a 240-mile transmission line from Minnesota to North Dakota. The company has filed to extend the licensing plants of its two nuclear plants on Prairie Island in Minnesota for 20 years, which it expects to save customers more than $1 billion compared to alternative sources.

Xcel plans to construct one of the largest biomass generating plants in the Midwest. The facility, proposed for the Bay Front Generating Station in Ashland, Wisconsin, will generate power from burning wood waste in all three operating units by 2014. In 2011 Xcel had 73 MW of biomass generating power in Minnesota and Wisconsin.

Xcel is also working to develop so-called ""smart grid"" technology, which will provide customers with more reliability and control over their energy use. It has completed the nation's first fully integrated SmartGridCity in Boulder, Colorado.

In 2010 Xcel acquired two gas-fired power plants from Calpine Corporation for $739 million. The two Denver-area plants have a generating capacity of more than 900 MW and were already providing power to Public Service Company of Colorado under a contract agreement. The company is planning to acquire 775 MW of new wind-power capacity for its Colorado system over the next several years. – less",Creative Copywriter,$55K-$91K,Creative writing Copywriting Advertising copy Content creation Brand storytelling Marketing campaigns Proofreading and editing,El Salvador,213681,San Salvador

A part of top US power firm Duke Energy, the regulated utility provides electricity services to about 2.4 million customers in North and South Carolina. Operating in a 24,000-square mile service territory, Duke Energy Carolinas has 101,400 miles of distribution cable. Its transmission system spans 13,100 miles. The utility has a net generating capacity of about 19,200 MW from interests in fossil-fueled, nuclear, and hydroelectric power plants. Duke Energy Carolinas also sells power to wholesale customers.

The utility's three nuclear plants account for more than a quarter of Duke Energy Carolinas' generating capacity.

Duke Energy Carolinas is investing $7 billion from 2010 to 2012 to expand its generating capacity and maintain its nuclear fuel and plants. By 2020 the company is looking to expand capacity by 5,400 MW, a strategy that brings new plants online while replacing older, less efficient ones.

The global recession produced weaker demand for power (especially from industrial customers) which lowered company revenues in 2009. However, the same downturn cut fuel expenses (including purchased power from third parties) resulting in only a slight dip in Duke Energy Carolinas' operating income.

In 2010 the company saw its revenues rise, primarily due to new retail electric base rates in North Carolina and South Carolina, and favorable weather conditions which spurred demand. Duke Energy Carolinas also posted higher net income, despite an increase in fuel costs and expenses related to an employee voluntary severance plan. – less",Interaction Designer,$62K-$86K,Interaction design principles User behavior and psychology Wireframing and prototyping tools Animation and micro-interaction design Collaborative design processes,Cambodia,3788,Phnom Penh

The utility holding company distributes electricity to 3.4 million customers and natural gas to 1.9 million in eight states through four regulated utilities; Colorado and Minnesota account for most of its customers. Its utilities -- Northern States Power (NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin), Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service (in New Mexico and Texas) -- have the combined capacity of more than 17,150 MW of electricity. Xcel owns transmission and distribution lines, as well as natural gas assets. It is also the top wind power provider in the US, with wind farms in Colorado, Minnesota, and Texas.

Geographic Reach

The company serves customers in Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin.

 

Operations

Xcel operates power and gas utilities: Northern States Power, Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service. The holding company has more than 80 generating plants, more than 87,750 miles of transmission lines and about 191,840 miles of distribution lines. It also operates an interstate natural gas pipeline company and a joint venture to develop and lease natural gas pipelines, storage, and compression assets.

Financial Analysis

In 2011 Xcel reported a 3% jump in sales due to an increase in demand caused by a warmer-than-normal summer and a colder-than-normal winter. It was also assisted by a 3.7% increase in the electric segment due to cost recovery of the acquisition of the Rocky Mountain and Blue Spruce natural gas facilities by Public Service Company of Colorado and by natural gas retail rate increases in Minnesota.

Net income rose by 11% thanks to higher revenues and lower electric fuel and purchased power costs.

Higher rates and increased weather-related demand helped sales in 2010 to rise nearly 7%, going from $9.6 billion to about $10.3 billion. 

Strategy

Xcel is an energy company in transition, with long-term plans to move from coal-fired plants to natural gas, and on to alternative fuels such as wind, solar, and biomass to boost its green  power capacity (88,705 MWh by 2015).

In 2012 the company was seeking proposals for renewable resources other than wind or solar as part of its plan to diversify Southwestern Public Service Company  renewable energy portfolio.

As the largest US utility wind energy provider, Xcel controlled some 3,500 MW of wind energy in its portfolio in 2011 and plans to have 7,400 MW by 2020. In 2011 Xcel bought the 200 MW Limon Wind Energy Center, which will have 125 turbines in Lincoln and Elbert counties on Colorado's Front Range east of Denver. The company is also the US's fifth-largest utility solar energy provider and owns the fourth-largest transmission system. In addition, Xcel operates more than 25 hydroelectric power plants in Colorado, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.

The company believes its strategy of making environmentally sound investments is pivotal to its success. Among its 2010 projects were launching its 800-MW coal-fired unit in Colorado, known as Comanche 3, after installing advanced emission-reduction equipment. It also began construction of its CapX2020 project, a joint venture transmission expansion project with 10 other utilities, scheduled for completion by 2020. The project includes a 240-mile transmission line from Minnesota to North Dakota. The company has filed to extend the licensing plants of its two nuclear plants on Prairie Island in Minnesota for 20 years, which it expects to save customers more than $1 billion compared to alternative sources.

Xcel plans to construct one of the largest biomass generating plants in the Midwest. The facility, proposed for the Bay Front Generating Station in Ashland, Wisconsin, will generate power from burning wood waste in all three operating units by 2014. In 2011 Xcel had 73 MW of biomass generating power in Minnesota and Wisconsin.

Xcel is also working to develop so-called ""smart grid"" technology, which will provide customers with more reliability and control over their energy use. It has completed the nation's first fully integrated SmartGridCity in Boulder, Colorado.

In 2010 Xcel acquired two gas-fired power plants from Calpine Corporation for $739 million. The two Denver-area plants have a generating capacity of more than 900 MW and were already providing power to Public Service Company of Colorado under a contract agreement. The company is planning to acquire 775 MW of new wind-power capacity for its Colorado system over the next several years. – less",User Researcher,$64K-$84K,User research methods Usability testing Data analysis and interpretation,New Caledonia,213656,Noumea

Western Digital,"{'Work Happiness Score': '69', 'Achievement': '79', 'Appreciation': '74', 'Flexibility': '74', 'Learning': '73', 'Purpose': '71', 'Trust': '69', 'Compensation': '69', 'Support': '69', 'Inclusion': '68', 'Energy': '67', 'Belonging': '66', 'Management': '65'}",3.8,"When it comes to data storage, Western Digital has drive. The company is one of the largest independent makers of hard-disk drives, which record, store, and recall volumes of data. Drives for PCs account for most of Western Digital's sales, although the company also makes devices used in servers, cloud computing data centers, and home entertainment products such as set-top boxes and video game consoles. The company sells to manufacturers and through retailers and distributors. More than 60% of its sales are to OEMs such as  Hewlett-Packard, which is Western Digital's largest customer. The company gets more than half of its sales from the Asia/Pacific region.

Operations

Western Digital is structured around two subsidiaries: WD Technologies and Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST). Each subsidiary maintains its own brand and product lines, with separate sales, marketing, operations, and product development teams. The company is looking to offer improved customer experiences for competing and complementary brands, while finding efficiencies in shared services.

Geographic Reach

The company is seeing strong growth in Asia (which represents more than 55% of sales) and the US (nearly 20%), with slower growth in the EMEA region (another nearly 20%). Western Digital has manufacturing facilities in the US and across Asia and sales offices worldwide.

Strategy

Western Digital is one of a handful of manufacturers that dominate the hard-disk drive market -- a sector characterized by harsh competition, short product life cycles, and aggressive price cuts. In order to reduce its dependence on drives for PCs, the company has branched into branded consumer media devices, including DVR expanders, portable media drives, and media players that let users play data from external drives on TV. Its WD TV Live Plus media player streams movies (including those offered by Netflix) and Internet video to a digital TV. It is also investing in products for the mobile computing and cloud computing markets.

Another promising market for Western Digital is nearline hard drives, which are more cost effective than traditional hard drives by providing more capacity while requiring lower power. Nearline hard drives are used for stimulated applications, such as video surveillance and medical imaging, and IT infrastructure applications, including scientific computing and Web search engines.

Mergers & Acquisitions

In 2012 Western Digital bought Hitachi's disk drive business, HGST, for around $4.3 billion in cash and stock. The deal boosts Western Digital's share of the global market to nearly 50%, ahead of rival Seagate Technology which accounts for around 30% of global shipments. Strategically, the deal adds disk drives used with servers -- a large part of both Hitachi and Seagate's businesses -- and gives Western Digital a better foothold in solid-state drives used in tablets and other portable devices. The acquisition also provides Western Digital its first manufacturing foothold in China and the Philippines. With the stock portion of the sale, Hitachi gains a 10% stake in Western Digital and two spots on the board of directors.

Western Digital has long used acquisitions to add new product lines and extend its geographic reach. Over the past several years it bought the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya for about $233 million and entered the market for solid-state drives with the $65 million purchase of SiliconSystems. In a large 2007 acquisition, Western Digital bought disk component maker Komag for $1 billion, which gave it the ability to manufacture the media and substrates used in its drives.

Financial Analysis

Western Digital's sales have fluctuated in recent years as it has dealt with the worldwide economic downturn. However, its acquisition of HGST helped produce strong results for fiscal 2012 (ended June 30). The company's revenues grew 31% that year to $12.5 billion, with HGST contributing more than $3 billion of that. It also saw an improvement in hard drive average selling price from $45 in fiscal 2011 to $62 in fiscal 2012.

Although Western Digital saw increased R&D and SG&A expenses in 2012, the overall strength of revenues led to a 122% jump in net income (to $1.6 billion). – less",Digital Marketing Coordinator,$62K-$130K,Digital marketing strategy development Social media advertising Email marketing Google Analytics and SEO Content management systems (CMS) proficiency,Luxembourg,43895,Luxembourg

It also engages in natural gas compressing, treating, processing, transporting, and selling. DCP Midstream LLC also transports and sells NGLs and distributes propane wholesale. The company operates natural gas gathering systems (5,300 miles of pipe) in eight states (including Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas), seven processing plants, four NGL pipelines, and nine propane storage terminals. Spectra Energy holds a 50% holding in DCP (ConocoPhillips holds the other 50%).

A consolidator in the fragmented natural gas gathering, NGLs, and wholesale propane industry segments, the company has been expanding its gas supply base and its propane wholesale network in recent years through strategic complementary acquisitions and joint ventures.

In 2012 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Texas-based Crossroads processing plant and gathering system from Penn Virginia Resource Partners for $63 million. The bolt-on acquisition allows the company to expand its market position in East Texas and provide services to drillers in the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley regions.

In 2011 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Seaway Products Pipeline Co. from ConocoPhillips. The pipeline, now called Southern Hills Pipeline and being converted to NGL service, is expected to be operational by mid-2013. It will provide NGL access from the Midcontinent to the Texas Gulf Coast.

The company agreed to form a joint venture with EQT Corporation to develop natural gas processing and related natural gas liquid (NGL) infrastructure in the Marcellus and Huron shale plays in the Appalachian basin. (However, the parties could not come to agreement and dropped the plan in early 2011). In 2010, the company acquired the Liberty gathering system and south Raywood processing plant from Ceritas Energy in southeast Texas. The pipeline system interconnects with DCP Midstream's Centana Intrastate Pipeline system.

Expanding in Michigan, in 2009 the company acquired gas gathering and treating assets for $45.1 million. In 2010 it acquired a 350-mile interstate natural gas liquids pipeline system in Colorado's Denver-Julesburg Basin from Buckeye Partners for $22 million.

In 2010 DCP Midstream Partners moved to extend its Northeast wholesale propane business into the MidAtlantic region, acquiring UGI's Atlantic Energy for $49 million. That year it also purchased of NGL storage company Marysville Hydrocarbon Holdings (in Michigan) for about $95 million.

Although DCP Midstream Partners' revenues suffered in 2009 as a result of the global recession and lower commodity prices, acquisitions and organic growth managed to offset lower natural gas volumes.  Acquisitions, increased demand, higher commodity and propane prices, and gains on derivatives help to lift the company's revenues and net income in 2010.

In terms of the company's origins, the D in DCP Midstream Partners (formerly Duke Energy Field Services) is for Duke Energy; the CP, ConocoPhillips. These two energy majors formed DCP Midstream Partners in 2005. Following the spinoff of Spectra Energy from Duke Energy in 2007, Spectra Energy assumed Duke Energy's 50% holding in DCP. – less",General Pediatrician,$57K-$104K,Pediatrics Pediatric care Diagnosis and treatment Pediatric medical procedures Patient care Communication skills,Marshall Islands,27072,Majuro

CenterPoint Energy's regulated utilities distribute natural gas to 3.3 million customers in six US states and electricity to more than 2 million customers on the Texas Gulf Coast. The company's main stomping ground is Texas, where it has regulated power distribution operations through subsidiary CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric. CenterPoint Energy operates more than 48,230 miles of power distribution lines, 8,000 miles of interstate gas pipeline, and 3,800 miles of gas gathering pipeline. It also provides natural gas field services. 

Operations

The company's natural gas distribution subsidiaries serve customers in Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas. (Texas represented 47% of all natural gas distribution customers in 2010). CenterPoint Energy also markets natural gas and related services to 12,200 commercial, industrial, and wholesale customers located primarily in the eastern US. It also provides HVAC and other energy-related services through its gas division.

Financial Analysis

CenterPoint Energy's sales dropped dramatically in 2009 as the global recession prompted a slump in commodity prices which hurt the performance of its different energy segments. A reviving economy in 2010 led to a stronger demand for power and gas (coupled with rate increases and weather-related spikes in consumption) resulting in a overall jump in revenues and net income that year.

Strategy

CenterPoint Energy's strategy is focused on enhancing and expanding existing core operations, while acquiring complementary and synergistic businesses. In 2011 the company acquired Denver-based natural gas marketing firm Asgard Energy, which supplies gas to agricultural, commercial, industrial, and residential customers in five states (Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, and West Virginia). The acquisition fit into CenterPoint's strategy to expand into the Rockies and diversify into residential choice markets.

In 2012, to add to its midstream assets, CenterPoint Energy Field Services (CEFS), an indirect subsidiary of the company, acquired gathering and processing assets from Prism Gas Systems, a subsidiary of Martin Midstream Partners for $275 million. The assets include Prism's 50% stake in Texas-based Waskom Gas Processing Co.

It focuses on exploration and production assets in Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming, and western Canada. In 2011 Devon Energy reported proved reserves of 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent (58% natural gas) and more than 19,900 net acres of assets. It also drilled almost 2,500 gross wells. Devon Energy produces about 2.5 billion cu. ft. of natural gas a day (more than 3% of all the gas consumed in North America). The company is the largest producer and lease holder in the Barnett Shale (Texas) and is looking to replicate its success there to other unconventional plays.

Geographic Reach

Once active in major oil patches worldwide such as Azerbaijan, Brazil, and China, in the mid-2000s the company decided to focus on safer and increasingly productive unconventional onshore exploration opportunities (shales and oil sands) in North America. As a result, Devon Energy has sold all of its international assets.

Financial Analysis

Devon Energy posted a major improvement in revenues in 2010, thanks to higher commodity prices and an increase in production. In 2011, buoyed by record level reserves, high oil prices, and an increased demand for oil and gas products, the company posted a further 15% growth in revenues. Net income only rose by 3%, however, as higher operating, depreciation, deletion, and amortization costs and an increase in deferred income tax expense trimmed income growth.

Boosting its financial resources, in 2012 Devon Energy secured a commitment from Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration & Production for the Chinese company to invest $2.2 billion in exchange for one-third of Devon's interest in five new joint venture plays in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, Niobrara, Mississippian, Ohio Utica Shale, and the Michigan Basin.

That year it also closed a similar $1.4 billion joint venture deal with Sumitomo Corp. to develop 650,000 net acres in the Cline Shale and the Midland-Wolfcamp Shale in West Texas.

Strategy

In 2010 it sold most of its remaining international assets to BP for $7 billion. As part of this deal BP sold undeveloped oil sand leases in Canada to Devon Energy for $500 million and formed a joint venture with the company to exploit them. The company also sold its Panyu field, offshore China, to China National Offshore Oil for $515 million.

Consolidating its North American assets to just its onshore properties, In 2010 Devon Energy sold its stakes in the Cascade, Jack and St. Malo fields in the Gulf of Mexico (about 200 million barrels of estimated recoverable reserves) to AP Moller-Maersk's oil unit for $1.3 billion. It also sold its remaining Gulf of Mexico shelf assets to Apache for $1 billion. – less",NoSQL Database Engineer,$58K-$90K,"NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra) Data modeling Data migration Performance tuning Scalability Distributed systems",Timor-Leste,176593,Dili

The company's primary operations include the manufacture of building block chemicals like acetic acid and vinyl acetate monomers. Those chemicals are used in everything from inks and paints to agricultural products and chewing gum. Canadian subsidiary Acetex, the majority of whose sales come from Europe, is the world's largest acetyls manufacturer. Other products include acetate tow (in cigarette filters); industrial specialties like ethylene vinyl aceta; and engineered plastics. The bulk of sales come from the US and Germany. 

Operations

Celanese operates through four business segments: Advanced Engineered Materials, Consumer Specialties, Industrial Specialties, and Acetyl Intermediates. The company is one of the world's largest producers of acetyl products, as well as a top global producer of engineered polymers.

Geographic Reach

In addition to manufacturing sites in the US, it also has properties, plants, and equipment in Belgium, China, Canada, Germany, Mexico, and Singapore.

Financial Analysis

Celanese continued its recovery from the recession of 2008-09 with a 14% increase in revenues in 2011, due primarily to higher volumes and increased sales prices across most of its business segments. The largest gains were in its Industrial Specialties unit (up 18%), Advanced Engineered Materials unit (up 17%), and its Acetyl Intermediates segment (up 15%). Net income grew by 61% in 2011, as increased revenues outpaced a more modest growth in operating expenses.

Strategy

Celanese's strategy is to grow the company through expansion into emerging regions, particularly China; to offer innovation through developing new products and applications; increase its productivity through energy reduction, business process improvements, and manufacturing optimization; and boost its portfolio by growing its business through both acquisitions or internal growth.

In 2012 the company teamed up with Indonesia's Pertamina, forming a joint venture to develop fuel ethanol projects in that country.

To grow its emulsion polymers business, in 2011 the company acquired two product lines, Vinac and Flexbond, from Ashland. The acquisition is expected to speed up growth of the company's emulsion polymers operations throughout the Americas -- especially in the adhesives, textiles, coatings, and paper segments.

Celanese subsidiary Ticona Engineering Polymers acquired two product lines, Zenite liquid crystal polymer and Thermx polycyclohexylene-dimethylene terephthalate, from DuPont Performance Polymers division in 2010. The units expanded Celanese's offerings in the electrical and electronics application segments of the global polymers market. 

Ownership

In 2012 Capital Research Global Investors owned about 11% of Celanese, with several other investment firms owning a smaller stakes.

Company Background

Celanese Corporation was created in 2004 by the Blackstone Group, which had acquired a majority share in Celanese AG, turned it private, and then flipped it in a 2005 public offering.

We are a leading, multi-category consumer goods company that provides tobacco and nicotine products to hundreds of millions of adult consumers worldwide.

For decades, we have built our business on successfully meeting the preferences of adult smokers with world-famous cigarette brands, superior blends and market-leading innovations.

We have been satisfying consumers, delivering shareholder value and creating valued employment for over a century. However, we are entering the most dynamic period of change our industry has ever encountered.

An unprecedented confluence of technology, societal change and public health awareness has created a unique opportunity: the opportunity to make a substantial leap forward in our long-held ambition to provide our consumers with potentially reduced-risk tobacco and nicotine choices.

Our acquisition of Reynolds American Inc. (RAI) in July 2017, which has transformed both the scale and geographic reach of our business and our portfolio of potentially reduced-risk products, now positions us perfectly to capitalise on this ambition.

We call this ambition Transforming Tobacco and we are fully committed to leading this transformation.


The way our people operate is embodied in our four Guiding Principles: Enterprising Spirit, Freedom Through Responsibility, Open Minded and Strength from Diversity. These principles underpin our culture and guide how we deliver our strategy.

The culture of the Group is about developing talent from within, stretching and supporting the high performing managers who will lead the delivery of our strategy. In 2017, over 92% of our senior appointments were drawn from people already within the business – moves that have helped deliver stronger and more diverse leadership teams.

Our employer brand – ‘Bring your Difference’ – has a strong presence across social media channels, including LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram. We are leading our industry in social media engagement and have moved ahead of several top FMCG companies.

Providing a safe place to work, protecting our employees’ wellbeing and listening to their views are also fundamental.

It also engages in natural gas compressing, treating, processing, transporting, and selling. DCP Midstream LLC also transports and sells NGLs and distributes propane wholesale. The company operates natural gas gathering systems (5,300 miles of pipe) in eight states (including Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas), seven processing plants, four NGL pipelines, and nine propane storage terminals. Spectra Energy holds a 50% holding in DCP (ConocoPhillips holds the other 50%).

A consolidator in the fragmented natural gas gathering, NGLs, and wholesale propane industry segments, the company has been expanding its gas supply base and its propane wholesale network in recent years through strategic complementary acquisitions and joint ventures.

In 2012 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Texas-based Crossroads processing plant and gathering system from Penn Virginia Resource Partners for $63 million. The bolt-on acquisition allows the company to expand its market position in East Texas and provide services to drillers in the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley regions.

In 2011 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Seaway Products Pipeline Co. from ConocoPhillips. The pipeline, now called Southern Hills Pipeline and being converted to NGL service, is expected to be operational by mid-2013. It will provide NGL access from the Midcontinent to the Texas Gulf Coast.

The company agreed to form a joint venture with EQT Corporation to develop natural gas processing and related natural gas liquid (NGL) infrastructure in the Marcellus and Huron shale plays in the Appalachian basin. (However, the parties could not come to agreement and dropped the plan in early 2011). In 2010, the company acquired the Liberty gathering system and south Raywood processing plant from Ceritas Energy in southeast Texas. The pipeline system interconnects with DCP Midstream's Centana Intrastate Pipeline system.

Expanding in Michigan, in 2009 the company acquired gas gathering and treating assets for $45.1 million. In 2010 it acquired a 350-mile interstate natural gas liquids pipeline system in Colorado's Denver-Julesburg Basin from Buckeye Partners for $22 million.

In 2010 DCP Midstream Partners moved to extend its Northeast wholesale propane business into the MidAtlantic region, acquiring UGI's Atlantic Energy for $49 million. That year it also purchased of NGL storage company Marysville Hydrocarbon Holdings (in Michigan) for about $95 million.

Although DCP Midstream Partners' revenues suffered in 2009 as a result of the global recession and lower commodity prices, acquisitions and organic growth managed to offset lower natural gas volumes.  Acquisitions, increased demand, higher commodity and propane prices, and gains on derivatives help to lift the company's revenues and net income in 2010.

In terms of the company's origins, the D in DCP Midstream Partners (formerly Duke Energy Field Services) is for Duke Energy; the CP, ConocoPhillips. These two energy majors formed DCP Midstream Partners in 2005. Following the spinoff of Spectra Energy from Duke Energy in 2007, Spectra Energy assumed Duke Energy's 50% holding in DCP. – less",Market Research Coordinator,$64K-$115K,Market research coordination Survey design and administration Data analysis,Netherlands,25819,Amsterdam

It focuses on exploration and production assets in Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming, and western Canada. In 2011 Devon Energy reported proved reserves of 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent (58% natural gas) and more than 19,900 net acres of assets. It also drilled almost 2,500 gross wells. Devon Energy produces about 2.5 billion cu. ft. of natural gas a day (more than 3% of all the gas consumed in North America). The company is the largest producer and lease holder in the Barnett Shale (Texas) and is looking to replicate its success there to other unconventional plays.

Geographic Reach

Once active in major oil patches worldwide such as Azerbaijan, Brazil, and China, in the mid-2000s the company decided to focus on safer and increasingly productive unconventional onshore exploration opportunities (shales and oil sands) in North America. As a result, Devon Energy has sold all of its international assets.

Financial Analysis

Devon Energy posted a major improvement in revenues in 2010, thanks to higher commodity prices and an increase in production. In 2011, buoyed by record level reserves, high oil prices, and an increased demand for oil and gas products, the company posted a further 15% growth in revenues. Net income only rose by 3%, however, as higher operating, depreciation, deletion, and amortization costs and an increase in deferred income tax expense trimmed income growth.

Boosting its financial resources, in 2012 Devon Energy secured a commitment from Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration & Production for the Chinese company to invest $2.2 billion in exchange for one-third of Devon's interest in five new joint venture plays in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, Niobrara, Mississippian, Ohio Utica Shale, and the Michigan Basin.

That year it also closed a similar $1.4 billion joint venture deal with Sumitomo Corp. to develop 650,000 net acres in the Cline Shale and the Midland-Wolfcamp Shale in West Texas.

Strategy

In 2010 it sold most of its remaining international assets to BP for $7 billion. As part of this deal BP sold undeveloped oil sand leases in Canada to Devon Energy for $500 million and formed a joint venture with the company to exploit them. The company also sold its Panyu field, offshore China, to China National Offshore Oil for $515 million.

Consolidating its North American assets to just its onshore properties, In 2010 Devon Energy sold its stakes in the Cascade, Jack and St. Malo fields in the Gulf of Mexico (about 200 million barrels of estimated recoverable reserves) to AP Moller-Maersk's oil unit for $1.3 billion. It also sold its remaining Gulf of Mexico shelf assets to Apache for $1 billion. – less",Classroom Teacher,$62K-$112K,Teaching pedagogy Classroom management Curriculum development Student assessment Differentiated instruction,Switzerland,175878,Bern

Western Digital,"{'Work Happiness Score': '69', 'Achievement': '79', 'Appreciation': '74', 'Flexibility': '74', 'Learning': '73', 'Purpose': '71', 'Trust': '69', 'Compensation': '69', 'Support': '69', 'Inclusion': '68', 'Energy': '67', 'Belonging': '66', 'Management': '65'}",3.8,"When it comes to data storage, Western Digital has drive. The company is one of the largest independent makers of hard-disk drives, which record, store, and recall volumes of data. Drives for PCs account for most of Western Digital's sales, although the company also makes devices used in servers, cloud computing data centers, and home entertainment products such as set-top boxes and video game consoles. The company sells to manufacturers and through retailers and distributors. More than 60% of its sales are to OEMs such as  Hewlett-Packard, which is Western Digital's largest customer. The company gets more than half of its sales from the Asia/Pacific region.

Operations

Western Digital is structured around two subsidiaries: WD Technologies and Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST). Each subsidiary maintains its own brand and product lines, with separate sales, marketing, operations, and product development teams. The company is looking to offer improved customer experiences for competing and complementary brands, while finding efficiencies in shared services.

Geographic Reach

The company is seeing strong growth in Asia (which represents more than 55% of sales) and the US (nearly 20%), with slower growth in the EMEA region (another nearly 20%). Western Digital has manufacturing facilities in the US and across Asia and sales offices worldwide.

Strategy

Western Digital is one of a handful of manufacturers that dominate the hard-disk drive market -- a sector characterized by harsh competition, short product life cycles, and aggressive price cuts. In order to reduce its dependence on drives for PCs, the company has branched into branded consumer media devices, including DVR expanders, portable media drives, and media players that let users play data from external drives on TV. Its WD TV Live Plus media player streams movies (including those offered by Netflix) and Internet video to a digital TV. It is also investing in products for the mobile computing and cloud computing markets.

Another promising market for Western Digital is nearline hard drives, which are more cost effective than traditional hard drives by providing more capacity while requiring lower power. Nearline hard drives are used for stimulated applications, such as video surveillance and medical imaging, and IT infrastructure applications, including scientific computing and Web search engines.

Mergers & Acquisitions

In 2012 Western Digital bought Hitachi's disk drive business, HGST, for around $4.3 billion in cash and stock. The deal boosts Western Digital's share of the global market to nearly 50%, ahead of rival Seagate Technology which accounts for around 30% of global shipments. Strategically, the deal adds disk drives used with servers -- a large part of both Hitachi and Seagate's businesses -- and gives Western Digital a better foothold in solid-state drives used in tablets and other portable devices. The acquisition also provides Western Digital its first manufacturing foothold in China and the Philippines. With the stock portion of the sale, Hitachi gains a 10% stake in Western Digital and two spots on the board of directors.

Western Digital has long used acquisitions to add new product lines and extend its geographic reach. Over the past several years it bought the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya for about $233 million and entered the market for solid-state drives with the $65 million purchase of SiliconSystems. In a large 2007 acquisition, Western Digital bought disk component maker Komag for $1 billion, which gave it the ability to manufacture the media and substrates used in its drives.

Financial Analysis

Western Digital's sales have fluctuated in recent years as it has dealt with the worldwide economic downturn. However, its acquisition of HGST helped produce strong results for fiscal 2012 (ended June 30). The company's revenues grew 31% that year to $12.5 billion, with HGST contributing more than $3 billion of that. It also saw an improvement in hard drive average selling price from $45 in fiscal 2011 to $62 in fiscal 2012.

Although Western Digital saw increased R&D and SG&A expenses in 2012, the overall strength of revenues led to a 122% jump in net income (to $1.6 billion). – less",Data Scientist,$64K-$110K,"Machine learning algorithms and libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch) Statistical analysis and modeling Data preprocessing and cleaning Big data technologies (e.g., Hadoop, Spark) Data visualization Strong programming skills (Python, R)",Kenya,44021,Nairobi

With operations in more than 50 countries and 25,000 employees worldwide, Avery Dennison serves customers with insights and innovations that help make brands more inspiring and the world more intelligent.
Avery Dennison Corporation (NYSE: AVY) is a Fortune 500® company with sales of $6 billion from continuing operations in 2015. We are based in Glendale, California.

The Avery Dennison story begins in 1935, with just a few spare parts, one very bright idea and a $100 loan.

Ray Stanton (“Stan”) Avery, a struggling clerk in Los Angeles, invented a smarter way for stores to price their products, then went on to pioneer the labeling industry.

With a few simple materials—primarily used machine parts and a saber saw—Stan created and patented the first self-adhesive, die-cut labeling machine. His practical genius would ultimately yield eighteen patents and establish Avery Adhesives as the company that transformed how brands and businesses deliver information. In 1990, Avery International merged with Dennison Manufacturing to become Avery Dennison.

Today, we manufacture and distribute labeling and packaging materials in over 50 countries and employ more than 25,000 people. The flexibility and responsiveness afforded by our company's global footprint enables us to service our customers at key points throughout their supply chain.

In just over 80 years we have grown from one bright idea into a global corporation that continues to set new standards for quality and innovation in materials science.

Avery Dennison manufactures and distributes display graphics, labeling and packaging materials, retail graphic embellishments and RFID tags that companies around the world use to engage customers and efficiently manage their inventories. Our products are virtually everywhere you look, providing a crucial thread in the fabric of global commerce.

We sustain Stan Avery's spirit of curiosity through research, invention and development of new materials science products and processes. Our expertise in high-speed manufacturing, information display and management, logistics, branding, graphics and packaging enables us to impact a wide array of markets—from consumer packaged goods and apparel to transportation, architecture and healthcare.

We strive to make each customer's brand more inspiring and every process more intelligent.

Avery Dennison's extensive experience in our core businesses allows us to purchase, process, and deliver needed materials to key points in our customers' supply chains with rapid and globally consistent execution.

In the 21st century, the company will expand its footprint in emerging markets.

The pursuit of this vision has compelled us to align our businesses into a focused, customer-driven company that specializes in materials science. Our in-depth pool of expertise and global scale enable us to deliver insights, innovative products and intelligent solutions to customers all over the world. – less",Small Animal Veterinarian,$58K-$80K,Veterinary medicine Small animal care and surgery Animal diagnostics Preventive medicine Client communication Surgical skills Radiology Anesthesia Laboratory diagnostics Compassion and empathy Problem-solving Attention to detail,Guinea-Bissau,211735,Bissau

The utility has a net generating capacity of about 19,200 MW from interests in fossil-fueled, nuclear, and hydroelectric power plants. Duke Energy Carolinas also sells power to wholesale customers.

The utility's three nuclear plants account for more than a quarter of Duke Energy Carolinas' generating capacity.

Duke Energy Carolinas is investing $7 billion from 2010 to 2012 to expand its generating capacity and maintain its nuclear fuel and plants. By 2020 the company is looking to expand capacity by 5,400 MW, a strategy that brings new plants online while replacing older, less efficient ones.

The global recession produced weaker demand for power (especially from industrial customers) which lowered company revenues in 2009. However, the same downturn cut fuel expenses (including purchased power from third parties) resulting in only a slight dip in Duke Energy Carolinas' operating income.

In 2010 the company saw its revenues rise, primarily due to new retail electric base rates in North Carolina and South Carolina, and favorable weather conditions which spurred demand. Duke Energy Carolinas also posted higher net income, despite an increase in fuel costs and expenses related to an employee voluntary severance plan. – less",Account Executive,$62K-$128K,Sales strategy and planning Account management Customer relationship management Solution selling Sales forecasting Contract negotiation Sales metrics and reporting,Togo,3753,LomÃ©

Its Ameriprise Bank subsidiary offers deposits and loans. Ameriprise, which has about $630 billion of assets under management, distributes its products primarily through a network of more than 9,700 financial advisors.

The company has been sharpening its focus on its branded adviser network. It sold its Securities America independent broker-dealer subsidiary to Ladenburg Thalmann for some $150 million in 2011. Shortly before the sale of the troubled unit, Ameriprise agreed to pay $160 million to settle claims that Securities America brokers sold securities in fraudulent companies.

Ameriprise has been steadily boosting its assets under management and growing its client base (focusing on the affluent and mass affluent with at least $100,000 in investable assets). The company also is focused on geographic areas where those clients are congregated and has closed or consolidated offices in areas with less potential. While Columbia Management covers Ameriprise's main asset management market in the US, the company is increasing its global presence through its Threadneedle brand overseas. Ameriprise plans to grow its asset management operations in Europe, as well as in Australia, the Middle East, and Asia.

Ameriprise's strategies have paid off. Volatile financial market conditions, which negatively impacted all of the company's operations, led to a decline in revenue in 2008 and 2009. However, the company returned to success in 2010 and revenues grew by more than 20% that year. Poor economic conditions continued in 2011. However, Ameriprise's operating net revenues climbed that year by about 10%. The boost was due to strong growth in the company's fee-based advisory and asset management businesses.

Subsidiary Pacific Life & Annuity offers the same mix of life insurance and investment products and services for individuals and businesses in New York. Pacific Life was founded in 1868.

Operations

Pacific Life policyholders are members of parent Pacific Mutual Holding Company, which was created in 1997 following a conversion to the mutual holding company structure. Pacific LifeCorp is the intermediate stock holding company.

While life insurance is the company's bread and butter, it has brought in other operations for variety. Pacific Life's Aviation Capital Group subsidiary leases commercial jets to 90 airlines in more than 40 countries. It also manages aircraft assets for third parties such as commercial airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and financial institutions. Other subsidiaries include Pacific Asset Management, which provides third-party institutional asset management.

Sales & Marketing

Pacific Life's insurance policies are sold through independent distributors and through dealer/broker subsidiary Pacific Select Distributors.

Financial Analysis

The company's growth strategies helped Pacific Life achieve strong results in 2011, with revenues increasing 15% over 2010 to almost 6.7 billion, and net income increasing 29% to $679 million. Its operating income climbed a whopping 40% over 2010 to reach $823 million. The gains achieved were attributed to enhanced service offerings, expanded life insurance, annuity, and mutual fund product offerings, and the two acquisitions made that year.

Strategy

Being a mutual company, Pacific Life operates with a long-term focus to serve in the best interests of its policyholders and clients. in doing so, the company navigated the chilly economic waters of the 2008-2009 recession by steadily introducing new products and building up its capital reserves. By 2010 its net income had grown as risk-weary customers squirreled more of their savings and retirement monies into life insurance and mutual funds.

Mergers, Acquisitions & Divestitures

In 2008 the company added international reinsurance to its portfolio when it acquired the former London-based specialty reinsurance operations of Scottish Re and renamed the business as Pacific Life Re. It then added life retrocession (reinsurance of a reinsurer) to its line-up in 2011 by acquiring that business from Manulife and expanded its business to include the Toronto, Boston, Barbados, and Cologne markets.

Also in 2011 Pacific life bought JPMorgan Chase's pension risk advisory business to form Pacific Global Advisors. The unit offers risk management solutions and advisory services to pension plan sponsors.

The firm divested a noncore business, College Savings Bank, in 2012 to a syndicate of investors for an undisclosed price.

The company's main stomping ground is Texas, where it has regulated power distribution operations through subsidiary CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric. CenterPoint Energy operates more than 48,230 miles of power distribution lines, 8,000 miles of interstate gas pipeline, and 3,800 miles of gas gathering pipeline. It also provides natural gas field services. 

Operations

The company's natural gas distribution subsidiaries serve customers in Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas.

CenterPoint Energy also markets natural gas and related services to 12,200 commercial, industrial, and wholesale customers located primarily in the eastern US. It also provides HVAC and other energy-related services through its gas division.

Financial Analysis

CenterPoint Energy's sales dropped dramatically in 2009 as the global recession prompted a slump in commodity prices which hurt the performance of its different energy segments. A reviving economy in 2010 led to a stronger demand for power and gas (coupled with rate increases and weather-related spikes in consumption) resulting in a overall jump in revenues and net income that year.

Strategy

CenterPoint Energy's strategy is focused on enhancing and expanding existing core operations, while acquiring complementary and synergistic businesses. In 2011 the company acquired Denver-based natural gas marketing firm Asgard Energy, which supplies gas to agricultural, commercial, industrial, and residential customers in five states (Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, and West Virginia). The acquisition fit into CenterPoint's strategy to expand into the Rockies and diversify into residential choice markets.

In 2012, to add to its midstream assets, CenterPoint Energy Field Services (CEFS), an indirect subsidiary of the company, acquired gathering and processing assets from Prism Gas Systems, a subsidiary of Martin Midstream Partners for $275 million.

Ameriprise has been steadily boosting its assets under management and growing its client base (focusing on the affluent and mass affluent with at least $100,000 in investable assets). The company also is focused on geographic areas where those clients are congregated and has closed or consolidated offices in areas with less potential. While Columbia Management covers Ameriprise's main asset management market in the US, the company is increasing its global presence through its Threadneedle brand overseas. Ameriprise plans to grow its asset management operations in Europe, as well as in Australia, the Middle East, and Asia.

Ameriprise's strategies have paid off. Volatile financial market conditions, which negatively impacted all of the company's operations, led to a decline in revenue in 2008 and 2009. However, the company returned to success in 2010 and revenues grew by more than 20% that year. Poor economic conditions continued in 2011. However, Ameriprise's operating net revenues climbed that year by about 10%. The boost was due to strong growth in the company's fee-based advisory and asset management businesses.

The company's primary operations include the manufacture of building block chemicals like acetic acid and vinyl acetate monomers. Those chemicals are used in everything from inks and paints to agricultural products and chewing gum. Canadian subsidiary Acetex, the majority of whose sales come from Europe, is the world's largest acetyls manufacturer. Other products include acetate tow (in cigarette filters); industrial specialties like ethylene vinyl aceta; and engineered plastics. The bulk of sales come from the US and Germany. 

Operations

Celanese operates through four business segments: Advanced Engineered Materials, Consumer Specialties, Industrial Specialties, and Acetyl Intermediates. The company is one of the world's largest producers of acetyl products, as well as a top global producer of engineered polymers.

Geographic Reach

In addition to manufacturing sites in the US, it also has properties, plants, and equipment in Belgium, China, Canada, Germany, Mexico, and Singapore.

Financial Analysis

Celanese continued its recovery from the recession of 2008-09 with a 14% increase in revenues in 2011, due primarily to higher volumes and increased sales prices across most of its business segments. The largest gains were in its Industrial Specialties unit (up 18%), Advanced Engineered Materials unit (up 17%), and its Acetyl Intermediates segment (up 15%). Net income grew by 61% in 2011, as increased revenues outpaced a more modest growth in operating expenses.

Strategy

Celanese's strategy is to grow the company through expansion into emerging regions, particularly China; to offer innovation through developing new products and applications; increase its productivity through energy reduction, business process improvements, and manufacturing optimization; and boost its portfolio by growing its business through both acquisitions or internal growth.

In 2012 the company teamed up with Indonesia's Pertamina, forming a joint venture to develop fuel ethanol projects in that country.

To grow its emulsion polymers business, in 2011 the company acquired two product lines, Vinac and Flexbond, from Ashland. The acquisition is expected to speed up growth of the company's emulsion polymers operations throughout the Americas -- especially in the adhesives, textiles, coatings, and paper segments.

Celanese subsidiary Ticona Engineering Polymers acquired two product lines, Zenite liquid crystal polymer and Thermx polycyclohexylene-dimethylene terephthalate, from DuPont Performance Polymers division in 2010. The units expanded Celanese's offerings in the electrical and electronics application segments of the global polymers market. 

Ownership

In 2012 Capital Research Global Investors owned about 11% of Celanese, with several other investment firms owning a smaller stakes.

Company Background

Celanese Corporation was created in 2004 by the Blackstone Group, which had acquired a majority share in Celanese AG, turned it private, and then flipped it in a 2005 public offering. Blackstone finally divested its remaining holdings in Celanese in 2007. – less",Recruitment Coordinator,$56K-$120K,Recruitment process Candidate screening Applicant tracking systems Communication,Sri Lanka,81264,Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte

It's the #3 broadline foodservice distributor in the US (behind SYSCO and U.S. Foodservice). Through its Foodservice division, PFG supplies more than 68,000 products to independent restaurants, hotels, other hospitality operators, and healthcare facilities through some 20 distribution facilities. The PFG Customized distribution unit serves chain restaurants such as Cracker Barrel and Ruby Tuesday. PFG subsidiary Vistar is a distributor of candy, snacks, and convenience foods for vending operators, retailers, and concessions. The company is owned by The Blackstone Group and Wellspring Capital Management, which took the business private in 2008.

Operations

With the $1.3 billion buyout in 2008 PFG was merged with Colorado-based Vistar (which was already controlled by Blackstone) to create a giant in the foodservice distribution industry with tentacles reaching into several markets. The combined business continues to operate under the PFG name, although each unit maintains its own headquarters. Across the company's foodservice, Vistar, and customized distribution businesses PFG collectively delivers more than 98,000 national- and proprietary-branded food and food-related products to more than 128,000 customers. As part of its operations, PFG maintains about 70 distribution centers and more than a dozen Merchant's Mart locations in the US.

Strategy

For PFG's broadline Performance Foodservice division, the focus has been on building the range of products it distributes to existing customers while improving margins. The division's more than 41,000 customers, located in about 40 countries, include franchisees of such chains as Burger King, Popeyes (owned by AFC Enterprises), and Subway. It also serves contract foodservice operators, such as Compass Group North America.

Mergers and Acquisitions

The company moved to expand its broadline division in mid-2012 by acquiring Carolina-based rival Institution Food House from Alex Lee. It also entered into an agreement in late 2012 to buy independent broadline foodservice distributor Fox River Foods, which serves seven states primarily in the Upper Midwestern region. The deals followed PFG's purchase in 2010 of Ledyard Company, which serves central and northern California. To add breadth to its product offering at its New England and Ohio offices, PFG in 2010 bought out the assets of VME Distributors. The wholesale supplier catered to mobile caterers, office coffee services, schools, prisons, and vending operators that do business in New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. – less",Orthopedic Physical Therapist,$58K-$123K,Orthopedic assessment and treatment Rehabilitation exercises Patient education,France,295596,Paris

Operating in a 24,000-square mile service territory, Duke Energy Carolinas has 101,400 miles of distribution cable. Its transmission system spans 13,100 miles. The utility has a net generating capacity of about 19,200 MW from interests in fossil-fueled, nuclear, and hydroelectric power plants. Duke Energy Carolinas also sells power to wholesale customers.

The utility's three nuclear plants account for more than a quarter of Duke Energy Carolinas' generating capacity.

Duke Energy Carolinas is investing $7 billion from 2010 to 2012 to expand its generating capacity and maintain its nuclear fuel and plants. By 2020 the company is looking to expand capacity by 5,400 MW, a strategy that brings new plants online while replacing older, less efficient ones.

The global recession produced weaker demand for power (especially from industrial customers) which lowered company revenues in 2009. However, the same downturn cut fuel expenses (including purchased power from third parties) resulting in only a slight dip in Duke Energy Carolinas' operating income.

In 2010 the company saw its revenues rise, primarily due to new retail electric base rates in North Carolina and South Carolina, and favorable weather conditions which spurred demand. Duke Energy Carolinas also posted higher net income, despite an increase in fuel costs and expenses related to an employee voluntary severance plan. – less",Social Media Analyst,$65K-$99K,"Social media analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics, Facebook Insights) Data analysis and reporting Social media ROI measurement Competitive analysis Trend identification",Myanmar,3992,Naypyidaw

It also engages in natural gas compressing, treating, processing, transporting, and selling. DCP Midstream LLC also transports and sells NGLs and distributes propane wholesale. The company operates natural gas gathering systems (5,300 miles of pipe) in eight states (including Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas), seven processing plants, four NGL pipelines, and nine propane storage terminals. Spectra Energy holds a 50% holding in DCP (ConocoPhillips holds the other 50%).

A consolidator in the fragmented natural gas gathering, NGLs, and wholesale propane industry segments, the company has been expanding its gas supply base and its propane wholesale network in recent years through strategic complementary acquisitions and joint ventures.

In 2012 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Texas-based Crossroads processing plant and gathering system from Penn Virginia Resource Partners for $63 million. The bolt-on acquisition allows the company to expand its market position in East Texas and provide services to drillers in the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley regions.

In 2011 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Seaway Products Pipeline Co. from ConocoPhillips. The pipeline, now called Southern Hills Pipeline and being converted to NGL service, is expected to be operational by mid-2013. It will provide NGL access from the Midcontinent to the Texas Gulf Coast.

The company agreed to form a joint venture with EQT Corporation to develop natural gas processing and related natural gas liquid (NGL) infrastructure in the Marcellus and Huron shale plays in the Appalachian basin. (However, the parties could not come to agreement and dropped the plan in early 2011). In 2010, the company acquired the Liberty gathering system and south Raywood processing plant from Ceritas Energy in southeast Texas. The pipeline system interconnects with DCP Midstream's Centana Intrastate Pipeline system.

Expanding in Michigan, in 2009 the company acquired gas gathering and treating assets for $45.1 million. In 2010 it acquired a 350-mile interstate natural gas liquids pipeline system in Colorado's Denver-Julesburg Basin from Buckeye Partners for $22 million.

In 2010 DCP Midstream Partners moved to extend its Northeast wholesale propane business into the MidAtlantic region, acquiring UGI's Atlantic Energy for $49 million. That year it also purchased of NGL storage company Marysville Hydrocarbon Holdings (in Michigan) for about $95 million.

Although DCP Midstream Partners' revenues suffered in 2009 as a result of the global recession and lower commodity prices, acquisitions and organic growth managed to offset lower natural gas volumes.  Acquisitions, increased demand, higher commodity and propane prices, and gains on derivatives help to lift the company's revenues and net income in 2010.

In terms of the company's origins, the D in DCP Midstream Partners (formerly Duke Energy Field Services) is for Duke Energy; the CP, ConocoPhillips. These two energy majors formed DCP Midstream Partners in 2005. Following the spinoff of Spectra Energy from Duke Energy in 2007, Spectra Energy assumed Duke Energy's 50% holding in DCP. – less",Commercial Landscape Architect,$58K-$119K,Landscape architecture Site planning Plant selection Environmental sustainability AutoCAD Project management,Syrian Arab Republic,25668,Damascus

Its Ameriprise Bank subsidiary offers deposits and loans. Ameriprise, which has about $630 billion of assets under management, distributes its products primarily through a network of more than 9,700 financial advisors.

The company has been sharpening its focus on its branded adviser network. It sold its Securities America independent broker-dealer subsidiary to Ladenburg Thalmann for some $150 million in 2011. Shortly before the sale of the troubled unit, Ameriprise agreed to pay $160 million to settle claims that Securities America brokers sold securities in fraudulent companies.

Ameriprise has been steadily boosting its assets under management and growing its client base (focusing on the affluent and mass affluent with at least $100,000 in investable assets). The company also is focused on geographic areas where those clients are congregated and has closed or consolidated offices in areas with less potential. While Columbia Management covers Ameriprise's main asset management market in the US, the company is increasing its global presence through its Threadneedle brand overseas. Ameriprise plans to grow its asset management operations in Europe, as well as in Australia, the Middle East, and Asia.

Ameriprise's strategies have paid off. Volatile financial market conditions, which negatively impacted all of the company's operations, led to a decline in revenue in 2008 and 2009. However, the company returned to success in 2010 and revenues grew by more than 20% that year. Poor economic conditions continued in 2011. However, Ameriprise's operating net revenues climbed that year by about 10%. The boost was due to strong growth in the company's fee-based advisory and asset management businesses.

The bank is primarily active in the UK, where it has some 1,700 branches, but also has significant retail and commercial operations in Europe, Africa (it owns more than half of South African bank Absa Group), the Middle East, and the US. Barclays Bank offers standard retail services such as deposit accounts and lending, including Woolwich-brand mortgages. The bank also provides commercial money transfer services, insurance products, the Barclaycard line of credit cards, and financial advisory services. Barclays Bank traces its roots to the late 17th century.

Barclays Bank has been building up its portfolio of global credit card accounts, especially as other financial groups sell off noncore units during the economic recovery. In 2010 the company acquired the Italian credit card accounts of Citigroup in a deal that included some 197,000 card accounts and approximately €234 million ($320 million) worth of assets. It previously bought Goldfish, the struggling UK credit card unit of Discover Financial Services, for some £46 million ($70 million). In 2011 Barclays acquired Egg UK's credit card portfolio, which added more than 1 million accounts; it has agreed to buy more Citibank card accounts.

The bank has also been offloading some of its own holdings as part of an overall corporate restructuring. In 2010 Barclays sold its US subprime loan servicing business, HomEq Servicing, to Ocwen Financial. It also announced plans to abandon retail banking in certain international markets and instead focus on wholesale and commercial banking. In 2011 it shuttered its Indonesian retail unit Bank Akita, which it had acquired only two years before. The company also sold its Russian retail and commercial operations to a group of investors, citing difficulties competing in the market. Barclays will instead focus on its investment banking activities in the region.

In 2010 Barclays acquired Standard Life Bank from Standard Life for £226 million ($369 million). The deal added Standard Life's savings and mortgage books to the Barclays fold. Also as part of the deal, Barclays and Standard Life entered into a partnership whereby Barclays markets pension products to its clients.

Despite challenges in the economy, especially in regards to Europe's debt problems, Barclays Bank's revenues grew 8% in 2011. Its Africa business performed relatively strongly, with credit impairments improving, as did Barclaycard, thanks to the portfolio acquisitions which delivered profits. That year the bank closed nearly 150 European branches (largely located in Spain), the costs of which contributed to a 5% decline in net income. – less",Office Manager,$55K-$111K,Office administration and management Budgeting and expense tracking Team coordination and supervision Facility management Vendor and supplier relations,St. Martin (French part),234639,Marigot

The company offers financial planning, products, and services to individual and institutional investors. Through Ameriprise Financial, Columbia Management, RiverSource, and other affiliates and brands, the company provides access to insurance, mutual funds, savings plans, personal trust services, retail brokerage, and other financial products and services. Its Ameriprise Bank subsidiary offers deposits and loans. Ameriprise, which has about $630 billion of assets under management, distributes its products primarily through a network of more than 9,700 financial advisors.

The company has been sharpening its focus on its branded adviser network. It sold its Securities America independent broker-dealer subsidiary to Ladenburg Thalmann for some $150 million in 2011. Shortly before the sale of the troubled unit, Ameriprise agreed to pay $160 million to settle claims that Securities America brokers sold securities in fraudulent companies.

Ameriprise has been steadily boosting its assets under management and growing its client base (focusing on the affluent and mass affluent with at least $100,000 in investable assets). The company also is focused on geographic areas where those clients are congregated and has closed or consolidated offices in areas with less potential. While Columbia Management covers Ameriprise's main asset management market in the US, the company is increasing its global presence through its Threadneedle brand overseas. Ameriprise plans to grow its asset management operations in Europe, as well as in Australia, the Middle East, and Asia.

Ameriprise's strategies have paid off. Volatile financial market conditions, which negatively impacted all of the company's operations, led to a decline in revenue in 2008 and 2009. However, the company returned to success in 2010 and revenues grew by more than 20% that year. Poor economic conditions continued in 2011. However, Ameriprise's operating net revenues climbed that year by about 10%. The boost was due to strong growth in the company's fee-based advisory and asset management businesses.

With operations in more than 50 countries and 25,000 employees worldwide, Avery Dennison serves customers with insights and innovations that help make brands more inspiring and the world more intelligent.
Avery Dennison Corporation (NYSE: AVY) is a Fortune 500® company with sales of $6 billion from continuing operations in 2015. We are based in Glendale, California.

The Avery Dennison story begins in 1935, with just a few spare parts, one very bright idea and a $100 loan.

Ray Stanton (“Stan”) Avery, a struggling clerk in Los Angeles, invented a smarter way for stores to price their products, then went on to pioneer the labeling industry.

With a few simple materials—primarily used machine parts and a saber saw—Stan created and patented the first self-adhesive, die-cut labeling machine. His practical genius would ultimately yield eighteen patents and establish Avery Adhesives as the company that transformed how brands and businesses deliver information. In 1990, Avery International merged with Dennison Manufacturing to become Avery Dennison.

Today, we manufacture and distribute labeling and packaging materials in over 50 countries and employ more than 25,000 people. The flexibility and responsiveness afforded by our company's global footprint enables us to service our customers at key points throughout their supply chain.

In just over 80 years we have grown from one bright idea into a global corporation that continues to set new standards for quality and innovation in materials science.

Avery Dennison manufactures and distributes display graphics, labeling and packaging materials, retail graphic embellishments and RFID tags that companies around the world use to engage customers and efficiently manage their inventories. Our products are virtually everywhere you look, providing a crucial thread in the fabric of global commerce.

We sustain Stan Avery's spirit of curiosity through research, invention and development of new materials science products and processes. Our expertise in high-speed manufacturing, information display and management, logistics, branding, graphics and packaging enables us to impact a wide array of markets—from consumer packaged goods and apparel to transportation, architecture and healthcare.

We strive to make each customer's brand more inspiring and every process more intelligent.

Avery Dennison's extensive experience in our core businesses allows us to purchase, process, and deliver needed materials to key points in our customers' supply chains with rapid and globally consistent execution.

In the 21st century, the company will expand its footprint in emerging markets.

The pursuit of this vision has compelled us to align our businesses into a focused, customer-driven company that specializes in materials science. Our in-depth pool of expertise and global scale enable us to deliver insights, innovative products and intelligent solutions to customers all over the world. – less",IT Analyst,$63K-$107K,IT systems analysis Troubleshooting IT support and documentation,Honduras,211837,Tegucigalpa

The regulated utility, a subsidiary of Entergy, distributes electricity to 161,000 residential, commercial, and industrial customers and natural gas to more than 100,000 customers in Orleans Parish, Louisiana; it also owns two generating stations that give it more than 930 MW of generating capacity. 

Entergy New Orleans provides regulated electric and gas utility services to the population of New Orleans.

As a result of the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection a few weeks later; it emerged from bankruptcy in 2007.

After the onslaught of wind and rain caused by Katrina subsided, the city of New Orleans was left crippled and Entergy New Orleans' employees were scrambling to restore power to the city's pumping stations. The company was forced to create an interim headquarters in Clinton, Mississippi (a suburb of Jackson).

The mass evacuation and property damage caused by Hurricane Katrina severely reduced the population served by Entergy New Orleans. Before the big storm it had more than 190,000 electric customers and more than 144,000 gas customers.

The company reported a 10% drop in net revenue in 2011 due to lower electric rates and weak gas prices. However, net income jumped by $4.9 million thanks to lower operational and maintenance expenses, lower taxes, and lower interest expense.

To gain better financial returns, Entergy  plans to spin off its transmission businesses (including Entergy New Orleans') and merge them with a subsidiary of ITC Holdings.

In 2012, as part of a strategy to improve customer relations, Entergy New Orleans introduced a smartphone app to keep customers better informed about company and energy-related matters. – less",Brand Director,$61K-$120K,Brand strategy Brand development Creative direction Brand management Market research,Russia,105709,Moscow

The company's primary operations include the manufacture of building block chemicals like acetic acid and vinyl acetate monomers. Those chemicals are used in everything from inks and paints to agricultural products and chewing gum. Canadian subsidiary Acetex, the majority of whose sales come from Europe, is the world's largest acetyls manufacturer. Other products include acetate tow (in cigarette filters); industrial specialties like ethylene vinyl aceta; and engineered plastics. The bulk of sales come from the US and Germany. 

Operations

Celanese operates through four business segments: Advanced Engineered Materials, Consumer Specialties, Industrial Specialties, and Acetyl Intermediates. The company is one of the world's largest producers of acetyl products, as well as a top global producer of engineered polymers.

Geographic Reach

In addition to manufacturing sites in the US, it also has properties, plants, and equipment in Belgium, China, Canada, Germany, Mexico, and Singapore.

Financial Analysis

Celanese continued its recovery from the recession of 2008-09 with a 14% increase in revenues in 2011, due primarily to higher volumes and increased sales prices across most of its business segments. The largest gains were in its Industrial Specialties unit (up 18%), Advanced Engineered Materials unit (up 17%), and its Acetyl Intermediates segment (up 15%). Net income grew by 61% in 2011, as increased revenues outpaced a more modest growth in operating expenses.

Strategy

Celanese's strategy is to grow the company through expansion into emerging regions, particularly China; to offer innovation through developing new products and applications; increase its productivity through energy reduction, business process improvements, and manufacturing optimization; and boost its portfolio by growing its business through both acquisitions or internal growth.

In 2012 the company teamed up with Indonesia's Pertamina, forming a joint venture to develop fuel ethanol projects in that country.

To grow its emulsion polymers business, in 2011 the company acquired two product lines, Vinac and Flexbond, from Ashland. The acquisition is expected to speed up growth of the company's emulsion polymers operations throughout the Americas -- especially in the adhesives, textiles, coatings, and paper segments.

Celanese subsidiary Ticona Engineering Polymers acquired two product lines, Zenite liquid crystal polymer and Thermx polycyclohexylene-dimethylene terephthalate, from DuPont Performance Polymers division in 2010. The units expanded Celanese's offerings in the electrical and electronics application segments of the global polymers market. 

Ownership

In 2012 Capital Research Global Investors owned about 11% of Celanese, with several other investment firms owning a smaller stakes.

Company Background

Celanese Corporation was created in 2004 by the Blackstone Group, which had acquired a majority share in Celanese AG, turned it private, and then flipped it in a 2005 public offering. Blackstone finally divested its remaining holdings in Celanese in 2007. – less",Market Expansion Manager,$64K-$82K,Market expansion strategies Market research Sales planning and execution,Namibia,80637,Windhoek

The bank is primarily active in the UK, where it has some 1,700 branches, but also has significant retail and commercial operations in Europe, Africa (it owns more than half of South African bank Absa Group), the Middle East, and the US. Barclays Bank offers standard retail services such as deposit accounts and lending, including Woolwich-brand mortgages. The bank also provides commercial money transfer services, insurance products, the Barclaycard line of credit cards, and financial advisory services. Barclays Bank traces its roots to the late 17th century.

Barclays Bank has been building up its portfolio of global credit card accounts, especially as other financial groups sell off noncore units during the economic recovery. In 2010 the company acquired the Italian credit card accounts of Citigroup in a deal that included some 197,000 card accounts and approximately €234 million ($320 million) worth of assets. It previously bought Goldfish, the struggling UK credit card unit of Discover Financial Services, for some £46 million ($70 million). In 2011 Barclays acquired Egg UK's credit card portfolio, which added more than 1 million accounts; it has agreed to buy more Citibank card accounts.

The bank has also been offloading some of its own holdings as part of an overall corporate restructuring. In 2010 Barclays sold its US subprime loan servicing business, HomEq Servicing, to Ocwen Financial. It also announced plans to abandon retail banking in certain international markets and instead focus on wholesale and commercial banking. In 2011 it shuttered its Indonesian retail unit Bank Akita, which it had acquired only two years before. The company also sold its Russian retail and commercial operations to a group of investors, citing difficulties competing in the market. Barclays will instead focus on its investment banking activities in the region.

In 2010 Barclays acquired Standard Life Bank from Standard Life for £226 million ($369 million). The deal added Standard Life's savings and mortgage books to the Barclays fold. Also as part of the deal, Barclays and Standard Life entered into a partnership whereby Barclays markets pension products to its clients.

Despite challenges in the economy, especially in regards to Europe's debt problems, Barclays Bank's revenues grew 8% in 2011. Its Africa business performed relatively strongly, with credit impairments improving, as did Barclaycard, thanks to the portfolio acquisitions which delivered profits. That year the bank closed nearly 150 European branches (largely located in Spain), the costs of which contributed to a 5% decline in net income. – less",Wealth Advisor,$64K-$106K,Financial planning Investment knowledge Relationship management Communication skills Analytical skills,Yemen,234971,Sanaa

The company sells some 30 brands of cars and light trucks and offers vehicle financing. Chairman Smith, who runs Sonic Automotive with his son Scott, is also the majority owner of Speedway Motorsports, which operates more than half a dozen NASCAR auto racetracks.

Financial Analysis

Overall, the company's revenues in 2011 accounted for some $7.8 billion versus around $3.6 billion in 2010. Net income came in at $77.6 million in 2011 compared to $95.9 million in 2010, a 15% decrease. In 2011 the impact of earthquakes and the tsunami that struck Japan disrupted the company's Japanese supply chain and vehicle production. Sonic's new vehicle revenues and gross margins were impacted, thus affecting net income. Sonics' new vehicle sales generated around $4.3 million (about 55% of revenues) in revenues in 2011; used vehicle sales accounted for some $2 million (around 25% of revenues), and the company's parts, service and collision segment accounted for around $1.2 million (some 15% of revenues) in revenues.

Operations

In 2011 the company sold approximately 12.7 million new vehicles compared to 11.6 million vehicles sold in 2010, a year-over-year increase of some 10%. The company sells new vehicles, including luxury (BMW, Lexus, Land Rover, and Volvo), mid-line import (Honda, Nissan, and Toyota), and domestic brands (Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors). Its luxury brands generated some 50% of revenues in 2011; while the company's mid-line and domestic brands accounted for about 35% and 15%, respectively.

Strategy

As part of the company's strategic plans, Sonic is primarily focused in growing its operations in metropolitan markets in the Southeast, Southwest, Midwest, and the West (California). The company's long-term growth strategy is to target luxury or mid-line import brands.

Progressive people work hard to keep us at the top of our industry, and are rewarded for it—with competitive pay, great benefits, the possibility of bonuses based on company performance, work-life balance opportunities, on-site fitness and health centers, and other special perks.

And we know that cultivating a diverse, inclusive, and flexible work environment is critical to our achievements. That’s why we promote from within, work hard and get rewarded for it, and win the right way.

These groups provide development tools, networking opportunities, and interactive cultural celebrations that are just one piece of our open, supportive culture.

With operations in more than 50 countries and 25,000 employees worldwide, Avery Dennison serves customers with insights and innovations that help make brands more inspiring and the world more intelligent.
Avery Dennison Corporation (NYSE: AVY) is a Fortune 500® company with sales of $6 billion from continuing operations in 2015. We are based in Glendale, California.

The Avery Dennison story begins in 1935, with just a few spare parts, one very bright idea and a $100 loan.

Ray Stanton (“Stan”) Avery, a struggling clerk in Los Angeles, invented a smarter way for stores to price their products, then went on to pioneer the labeling industry.

With a few simple materials—primarily used machine parts and a saber saw—Stan created and patented the first self-adhesive, die-cut labeling machine. His practical genius would ultimately yield eighteen patents and establish Avery Adhesives as the company that transformed how brands and businesses deliver information. In 1990, Avery International merged with Dennison Manufacturing to become Avery Dennison.

Today, we manufacture and distribute labeling and packaging materials in over 50 countries and employ more than 25,000 people. The flexibility and responsiveness afforded by our company's global footprint enables us to service our customers at key points throughout their supply chain.

In just over 80 years we have grown from one bright idea into a global corporation that continues to set new standards for quality and innovation in materials science.

Avery Dennison manufactures and distributes display graphics, labeling and packaging materials, retail graphic embellishments and RFID tags that companies around the world use to engage customers and efficiently manage their inventories. Our products are virtually everywhere you look, providing a crucial thread in the fabric of global commerce.

We sustain Stan Avery's spirit of curiosity through research, invention and development of new materials science products and processes. Our expertise in high-speed manufacturing, information display and management, logistics, branding, graphics and packaging enables us to impact a wide array of markets—from consumer packaged goods and apparel to transportation, architecture and healthcare.

We strive to make each customer's brand more inspiring and every process more intelligent.

Avery Dennison's extensive experience in our core businesses allows us to purchase, process, and deliver needed materials to key points in our customers' supply chains with rapid and globally consistent execution.

In the 21st century, the company will expand its footprint in emerging markets.

The pursuit of this vision has compelled us to align our businesses into a focused, customer-driven company that specializes in materials science. Our in-depth pool of expertise and global scale enable us to deliver insights, innovative products and intelligent solutions to customers all over the world. – less",Accessibility Developer,$65K-$96K,"Web accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG) Assistive technologies Accessibility testing tools HTML and CSS for accessibility ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) User experience (UX) for accessibility Usability testing with individuals with disabilities Collaboration Attention to detail",South Africa,211731,Pretoria

The company offers financial planning, products, and services to individual and institutional investors. Through Ameriprise Financial, Columbia Management, RiverSource, and other affiliates and brands, the company provides access to insurance, mutual funds, savings plans, personal trust services, retail brokerage, and other financial products and services. Its Ameriprise Bank subsidiary offers deposits and loans. Ameriprise, which has about $630 billion of assets under management, distributes its products primarily through a network of more than 9,700 financial advisors.

The company has been sharpening its focus on its branded adviser network. It sold its Securities America independent broker-dealer subsidiary to Ladenburg Thalmann for some $150 million in 2011. Shortly before the sale of the troubled unit, Ameriprise agreed to pay $160 million to settle claims that Securities America brokers sold securities in fraudulent companies.

Ameriprise has been steadily boosting its assets under management and growing its client base (focusing on the affluent and mass affluent with at least $100,000 in investable assets). The company also is focused on geographic areas where those clients are congregated and has closed or consolidated offices in areas with less potential. While Columbia Management covers Ameriprise's main asset management market in the US, the company is increasing its global presence through its Threadneedle brand overseas. Ameriprise plans to grow its asset management operations in Europe, as well as in Australia, the Middle East, and Asia.

Ameriprise's strategies have paid off. Volatile financial market conditions, which negatively impacted all of the company's operations, led to a decline in revenue in 2008 and 2009. However, the company returned to success in 2010 and revenues grew by more than 20% that year. Poor economic conditions continued in 2011. However, Ameriprise's operating net revenues climbed that year by about 10%. The boost was due to strong growth in the company's fee-based advisory and asset management businesses.

A part of top US power firm Duke Energy, the regulated utility provides electricity services to about 2.4 million customers in North and South Carolina. Operating in a 24,000-square mile service territory, Duke Energy Carolinas has 101,400 miles of distribution cable. Its transmission system spans 13,100 miles. The utility has a net generating capacity of about 19,200 MW from interests in fossil-fueled, nuclear, and hydroelectric power plants. Duke Energy Carolinas also sells power to wholesale customers.

The utility's three nuclear plants account for more than a quarter of Duke Energy Carolinas' generating capacity.

Duke Energy Carolinas is investing $7 billion from 2010 to 2012 to expand its generating capacity and maintain its nuclear fuel and plants. By 2020 the company is looking to expand capacity by 5,400 MW, a strategy that brings new plants online while replacing older, less efficient ones.

The global recession produced weaker demand for power (especially from industrial customers) which lowered company revenues in 2009. However, the same downturn cut fuel expenses (including purchased power from third parties) resulting in only a slight dip in Duke Energy Carolinas' operating income.

In 2010 the company saw its revenues rise, primarily due to new retail electric base rates in North Carolina and South Carolina, and favorable weather conditions which spurred demand. Duke Energy Carolinas also posted higher net income, despite an increase in fuel costs and expenses related to an employee voluntary severance plan. – less",Sales Representative,$62K-$80K,Sales techniques and strategies Relationship building CRM software usage Product knowledge Negotiation and closing skills,Kyrgyz Republic,4286,Bishkek

The holding company distributes electricity to 2.4 million customers and natural gas to 900,000 customers in Missouri and Illinois through utility subsidiaries. Ameren has a generating capacity of 16,000 MW (primarily coal-fired), most of which is controlled by utility Union Electric (which does business as Ameren Missouri) and nonregulated subsidiary AmerenEnergy Resources Generating Company. Ameren, which also supplies merchant generation power to third parties, operates a nuclear power facility, three hydroelectric plants, and several coal-fired plants and turbine combustion facilities. It also purchases power, including windpower.

Operations

In addition to operating power plants, Ameren procures natural gas for its affiliated companies, builds new power plants, and provides long-term energy supply contracts. It also markets and trades electricity to wholesale and retail customers and provides risk management and other energy-related services.

Financial Analysis

Ameren's overall revenues dipped in 2011. While increased rates helped to lift Ameren Missouri's revenues in 2011, Ameren Illinois' regulated segment and the merchant generation segment both reported a drop in revenues. In particular, low gas prices and a warm winter hurt gas revenues. However, lower purchased power and resale gas, coupled with a drop in goodwill, impairment, and other charges, helped to lift Ameren's net income for the year.

Favorable weather conditions (which increased energy demand) and rate increases help to lift the company's revenues in 2010. However, impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets in the merchant generation segment (due to the sustained decline in market prices for electricity) dragged down Ameren's operating income.

Strategy

In 2010 the company combined AmerenIP, AmerenCIPS, and AmerenCILCO into one entity, Ameren Illinois, in order to streamline operations and reduce confusion among customers. The three Illinois utilities have operated as a single business since 2004 and deliver energy to more than 1,100 communities. Ameren Illinois also operates some 21,400 miles of natural gas distribution and transmission lines.

To comply with federal requirements to separate ownership of power generation and transmission businesses, the operations of Ameren subsidiaries' transmission assets are under the control ofMidwest Independent Transmission System Operator, a regional transmission organization that coordinates power across 15 Midwestern states and one Canadian Province.  – less",Service Quality Assurance Manager,$59K-$91K,Quality assurance Quality control Process improvement Audit procedures Compliance standards Root cause analysis,Syrian Arab Republic,100272,Damascus

With operations in more than 50 countries and 25,000 employees worldwide, Avery Dennison serves customers with insights and innovations that help make brands more inspiring and the world more intelligent.
Avery Dennison Corporation (NYSE: AVY) is a Fortune 500® company with sales of $6 billion from continuing operations in 2015. We are based in Glendale, California.

The Avery Dennison story begins in 1935, with just a few spare parts, one very bright idea and a $100 loan.

Ray Stanton (“Stan”) Avery, a struggling clerk in Los Angeles, invented a smarter way for stores to price their products, then went on to pioneer the labeling industry.

With a few simple materials—primarily used machine parts and a saber saw—Stan created and patented the first self-adhesive, die-cut labeling machine. His practical genius would ultimately yield eighteen patents and establish Avery Adhesives as the company that transformed how brands and businesses deliver information. In 1990, Avery International merged with Dennison Manufacturing to become Avery Dennison.

Today, we manufacture and distribute labeling and packaging materials in over 50 countries and employ more than 25,000 people. The flexibility and responsiveness afforded by our company's global footprint enables us to service our customers at key points throughout their supply chain.

In just over 80 years we have grown from one bright idea into a global corporation that continues to set new standards for quality and innovation in materials science.

Avery Dennison manufactures and distributes display graphics, labeling and packaging materials, retail graphic embellishments and RFID tags that companies around the world use to engage customers and efficiently manage their inventories. Our products are virtually everywhere you look, providing a crucial thread in the fabric of global commerce.

We sustain Stan Avery's spirit of curiosity through research, invention and development of new materials science products and processes. Our expertise in high-speed manufacturing, information display and management, logistics, branding, graphics and packaging enables us to impact a wide array of markets—from consumer packaged goods and apparel to transportation, architecture and healthcare.

We strive to make each customer's brand more inspiring and every process more intelligent.

Avery Dennison's extensive experience in our core businesses allows us to purchase, process, and deliver needed materials to key points in our customers' supply chains with rapid and globally consistent execution.

In the 21st century, the company will expand its footprint in emerging markets.

The pursuit of this vision has compelled us to align our businesses into a focused, customer-driven company that specializes in materials science. Our in-depth pool of expertise and global scale enable us to deliver insights, innovative products and intelligent solutions to customers all over the world. – less",Interaction Designer,$58K-$106K,Interaction design principles User behavior and psychology Wireframing and prototyping tools Animation and micro-interaction design Collaborative design processes,Sint Maarten (Dutch part),211525,Philipsburg

The holding company distributes electricity to 2.4 million customers and natural gas to 900,000 customers in Missouri and Illinois through utility subsidiaries. Ameren has a generating capacity of 16,000 MW (primarily coal-fired), most of which is controlled by utility Union Electric (which does business as Ameren Missouri) and nonregulated subsidiary AmerenEnergy Resources Generating Company. Ameren, which also supplies merchant generation power to third parties, operates a nuclear power facility, three hydroelectric plants, and several coal-fired plants and turbine combustion facilities. It also purchases power, including windpower.

Operations

In addition to operating power plants, Ameren procures natural gas for its affiliated companies, builds new power plants, and provides long-term energy supply contracts. It also markets and trades electricity to wholesale and retail customers and provides risk management and other energy-related services.

Financial Analysis

Ameren's overall revenues dipped in 2011. While increased rates helped to lift Ameren Missouri's revenues in 2011, Ameren Illinois' regulated segment and the merchant generation segment both reported a drop in revenues. In particular, low gas prices and a warm winter hurt gas revenues. However, lower purchased power and resale gas, coupled with a drop in goodwill, impairment, and other charges, helped to lift Ameren's net income for the year.

Favorable weather conditions (which increased energy demand) and rate increases help to lift the company's revenues in 2010. However, impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets in the merchant generation segment (due to the sustained decline in market prices for electricity) dragged down Ameren's operating income.

Strategy

In 2010 the company combined AmerenIP, AmerenCIPS, and AmerenCILCO into one entity, Ameren Illinois, in order to streamline operations and reduce confusion among customers. The three Illinois utilities have operated as a single business since 2004 and deliver energy to more than 1,100 communities. Ameren Illinois also operates some 21,400 miles of natural gas distribution and transmission lines.

To comply with federal requirements to separate ownership of power generation and transmission businesses, the operations of Ameren subsidiaries' transmission assets are under the control ofMidwest Independent Transmission System Operator, a regional transmission organization that coordinates power across 15 Midwestern states and one Canadian Province.  – less",Water Resources Engineer,$63K-$130K,Water resources engineering Hydrology and hydraulics Environmental impact assessment Water resource modeling software Watershed management,St. Vincent and the Grenadines,100908,Kingstown

It also engages in natural gas compressing, treating, processing, transporting, and selling. DCP Midstream LLC also transports and sells NGLs and distributes propane wholesale. The company operates natural gas gathering systems (5,300 miles of pipe) in eight states (including Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas), seven processing plants, four NGL pipelines, and nine propane storage terminals. Spectra Energy holds a 50% holding in DCP (ConocoPhillips holds the other 50%).

A consolidator in the fragmented natural gas gathering, NGLs, and wholesale propane industry segments, the company has been expanding its gas supply base and its propane wholesale network in recent years through strategic complementary acquisitions and joint ventures.

In 2012 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Texas-based Crossroads processing plant and gathering system from Penn Virginia Resource Partners for $63 million. The bolt-on acquisition allows the company to expand its market position in East Texas and provide services to drillers in the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley regions.

In 2011 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Seaway Products Pipeline Co. from ConocoPhillips. The pipeline, now called Southern Hills Pipeline and being converted to NGL service, is expected to be operational by mid-2013. It will provide NGL access from the Midcontinent to the Texas Gulf Coast.

The company agreed to form a joint venture with EQT Corporation to develop natural gas processing and related natural gas liquid (NGL) infrastructure in the Marcellus and Huron shale plays in the Appalachian basin. (However, the parties could not come to agreement and dropped the plan in early 2011). In 2010, the company acquired the Liberty gathering system and south Raywood processing plant from Ceritas Energy in southeast Texas. The pipeline system interconnects with DCP Midstream's Centana Intrastate Pipeline system.

Expanding in Michigan, in 2009 the company acquired gas gathering and treating assets for $45.1 million. In 2010 it acquired a 350-mile interstate natural gas liquids pipeline system in Colorado's Denver-Julesburg Basin from Buckeye Partners for $22 million.

In 2010 DCP Midstream Partners moved to extend its Northeast wholesale propane business into the MidAtlantic region, acquiring UGI's Atlantic Energy for $49 million. That year it also purchased of NGL storage company Marysville Hydrocarbon Holdings (in Michigan) for about $95 million.

Although DCP Midstream Partners' revenues suffered in 2009 as a result of the global recession and lower commodity prices, acquisitions and organic growth managed to offset lower natural gas volumes.  Acquisitions, increased demand, higher commodity and propane prices, and gains on derivatives help to lift the company's revenues and net income in 2010.

Bruton Smith has raced Sonic Automotive to the front of the pack of US auto dealers behind larger rivals, such as AutoNation and Penske Automotive. Founded with five dealerships in 1997, Sonic today owns about 120 new- and used-vehicle dealerships and about 25 collision repair centers in major markets in 15 states, including Texas, the Carolinas, Tennessee and Georgia. The company sells some 30 brands of cars and light trucks and offers vehicle financing. Chairman Smith, who runs Sonic Automotive with his son Scott, is also the majority owner of Speedway Motorsports, which operates more than half a dozen NASCAR auto racetracks.

Financial Analysis

Overall, the company's revenues in 2011 accounted for some $7.8 billion versus around $3.6 billion in 2010. Net income came in at $77.6 million in 2011 compared to $95.9 million in 2010, a 15% decrease. In 2011 the impact of earthquakes and the tsunami that struck Japan disrupted the company's Japanese supply chain and vehicle production. Sonic's new vehicle revenues and gross margins were impacted, thus affecting net income. Sonics' new vehicle sales generated around $4.3 million (about 55% of revenues) in revenues in 2011; used vehicle sales accounted for some $2 million (around 25% of revenues), and the company's parts, service and collision segment accounted for around $1.2 million (some 15% of revenues) in revenues.

Operations

In 2011 the company sold approximately 12.7 million new vehicles compared to 11.6 million vehicles sold in 2010, a year-over-year increase of some 10%. The company sells new vehicles, including luxury (BMW, Lexus, Land Rover, and Volvo), mid-line import (Honda, Nissan, and Toyota), and domestic brands (Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors). Its luxury brands generated some 50% of revenues in 2011; while the company's mid-line and domestic brands accounted for about 35% and 15%, respectively.

Strategy

As part of the company's strategic plans, Sonic is primarily focused in growing its operations in metropolitan markets in the Southeast, Southwest, Midwest, and the West (California). The company's long-term growth strategy is to target luxury or mid-line import brands.

Ownership

The Smiths control the company through their ownership of about 75% of Sonic Automotive's voting stock. – less",Wealth Management Advisor,$63K-$123K,Wealth management strategies Asset allocation Estate planning Tax management Client relationship management,Tajikistan,62155,Dushanbe

The company offers financial planning, products, and services to individual and institutional investors. Through Ameriprise Financial, Columbia Management, RiverSource, and other affiliates and brands, the company provides access to insurance, mutual funds, savings plans, personal trust services, retail brokerage, and other financial products and services. Its Ameriprise Bank subsidiary offers deposits and loans. Ameriprise, which has about $630 billion of assets under management, distributes its products primarily through a network of more than 9,700 financial advisors.

The company has been sharpening its focus on its branded adviser network. It sold its Securities America independent broker-dealer subsidiary to Ladenburg Thalmann for some $150 million in 2011. Shortly before the sale of the troubled unit, Ameriprise agreed to pay $160 million to settle claims that Securities America brokers sold securities in fraudulent companies.

Ameriprise has been steadily boosting its assets under management and growing its client base (focusing on the affluent and mass affluent with at least $100,000 in investable assets). The company also is focused on geographic areas where those clients are congregated and has closed or consolidated offices in areas with less potential. While Columbia Management covers Ameriprise's main asset management market in the US, the company is increasing its global presence through its Threadneedle brand overseas. Ameriprise plans to grow its asset management operations in Europe, as well as in Australia, the Middle East, and Asia.

Ameriprise's strategies have paid off. Volatile financial market conditions, which negatively impacted all of the company's operations, led to a decline in revenue in 2008 and 2009. However, the company returned to success in 2010 and revenues grew by more than 20% that year. Poor economic conditions continued in 2011. However, Ameriprise's operating net revenues climbed that year by about 10%. The boost was due to strong growth in the company's fee-based advisory and asset management businesses.

Bruton Smith has raced Sonic Automotive to the front of the pack of US auto dealers behind larger rivals, such as AutoNation and Penske Automotive. Founded with five dealerships in 1997, Sonic today owns about 120 new- and used-vehicle dealerships and about 25 collision repair centers in major markets in 15 states, including Texas, the Carolinas, Tennessee and Georgia. The company sells some 30 brands of cars and light trucks and offers vehicle financing. Chairman Smith, who runs Sonic Automotive with his son Scott, is also the majority owner of Speedway Motorsports, which operates more than half a dozen NASCAR auto racetracks.

Financial Analysis

Overall, the company's revenues in 2011 accounted for some $7.8 billion versus around $3.6 billion in 2010. Net income came in at $77.6 million in 2011 compared to $95.9 million in 2010, a 15% decrease. In 2011 the impact of earthquakes and the tsunami that struck Japan disrupted the company's Japanese supply chain and vehicle production. Sonic's new vehicle revenues and gross margins were impacted, thus affecting net income. Sonics' new vehicle sales generated around $4.3 million (about 55% of revenues) in revenues in 2011; used vehicle sales accounted for some $2 million (around 25% of revenues), and the company's parts, service and collision segment accounted for around $1.2 million (some 15% of revenues) in revenues.

Operations

In 2011 the company sold approximately 12.7 million new vehicles compared to 11.6 million vehicles sold in 2010, a year-over-year increase of some 10%. The company sells new vehicles, including luxury (BMW, Lexus, Land Rover, and Volvo), mid-line import (Honda, Nissan, and Toyota), and domestic brands (Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors). Its luxury brands generated some 50% of revenues in 2011; while the company's mid-line and domestic brands accounted for about 35% and 15%, respectively.

Strategy

As part of the company's strategic plans, Sonic is primarily focused in growing its operations in metropolitan markets in the Southeast, Southwest, Midwest, and the West (California). The company's long-term growth strategy is to target luxury or mid-line import brands.

Ownership

The Smiths control the company through their ownership of about 75% of Sonic Automotive's voting stock. – less",Residential Interior Designer,$61K-$130K,Residential interior design Space planning Color theory and selection Furniture and materials selection 3D modeling and rendering,Northern Mariana Islands,63311,"Capitol Hill, Saipan"

CenterPoint Energy's regulated utilities distribute natural gas to 3.3 million customers in six US states and electricity to more than 2 million customers on the Texas Gulf Coast. The company's main stomping ground is Texas, where it has regulated power distribution operations through subsidiary CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric. CenterPoint Energy operates more than 48,230 miles of power distribution lines, 8,000 miles of interstate gas pipeline, and 3,800 miles of gas gathering pipeline. It also provides natural gas field services. 

Operations

The company's natural gas distribution subsidiaries serve customers in Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas. (Texas represented 47% of all natural gas distribution customers in 2010). CenterPoint Energy also markets natural gas and related services to 12,200 commercial, industrial, and wholesale customers located primarily in the eastern US. It also provides HVAC and other energy-related services through its gas division.

Financial Analysis

CenterPoint Energy's sales dropped dramatically in 2009 as the global recession prompted a slump in commodity prices which hurt the performance of its different energy segments. A reviving economy in 2010 led to a stronger demand for power and gas (coupled with rate increases and weather-related spikes in consumption) resulting in a overall jump in revenues and net income that year.

Strategy

CenterPoint Energy's strategy is focused on enhancing and expanding existing core operations, while acquiring complementary and synergistic businesses. In 2011 the company acquired Denver-based natural gas marketing firm Asgard Energy, which supplies gas to agricultural, commercial, industrial, and residential customers in five states (Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, and West Virginia). The acquisition fit into CenterPoint's strategy to expand into the Rockies and diversify into residential choice markets.

In 2012, to add to its midstream assets, CenterPoint Energy Field Services (CEFS), an indirect subsidiary of the company, acquired gathering and processing assets from Prism Gas Systems, a subsidiary of Martin Midstream Partners for $275 million. The assets include Prism's 50% stake in Texas-based Waskom Gas Processing Co.

Entergy New Orleans provides regulated electric and gas utility services to the population of New Orleans.

As a result of the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection a few weeks later; it emerged from bankruptcy in 2007.

After the onslaught of wind and rain caused by Katrina subsided, the city of New Orleans was left crippled and Entergy New Orleans' employees were scrambling to restore power to the city's pumping stations. The company was forced to create an interim headquarters in Clinton, Mississippi (a suburb of Jackson).

The mass evacuation and property damage caused by Hurricane Katrina severely reduced the population served by Entergy New Orleans. Before the big storm it had more than 190,000 electric customers and more than 144,000 gas customers.

The company reported a 10% drop in net revenue in 2011 due to lower electric rates and weak gas prices. However, net income jumped by $4.9 million thanks to lower operational and maintenance expenses, lower taxes, and lower interest expense.

Bruton Smith has raced Sonic Automotive to the front of the pack of US auto dealers behind larger rivals, such as AutoNation and Penske Automotive. Founded with five dealerships in 1997, Sonic today owns about 120 new- and used-vehicle dealerships and about 25 collision repair centers in major markets in 15 states, including Texas, the Carolinas, Tennessee and Georgia. The company sells some 30 brands of cars and light trucks and offers vehicle financing. Chairman Smith, who runs Sonic Automotive with his son Scott, is also the majority owner of Speedway Motorsports, which operates more than half a dozen NASCAR auto racetracks.

Financial Analysis

Overall, the company's revenues in 2011 accounted for some $7.8 billion versus around $3.6 billion in 2010. Net income came in at $77.6 million in 2011 compared to $95.9 million in 2010, a 15% decrease. In 2011 the impact of earthquakes and the tsunami that struck Japan disrupted the company's Japanese supply chain and vehicle production. Sonic's new vehicle revenues and gross margins were impacted, thus affecting net income. Sonics' new vehicle sales generated around $4.3 million (about 55% of revenues) in revenues in 2011; used vehicle sales accounted for some $2 million (around 25% of revenues), and the company's parts, service and collision segment accounted for around $1.2 million (some 15% of revenues) in revenues.

Operations

In 2011 the company sold approximately 12.7 million new vehicles compared to 11.6 million vehicles sold in 2010, a year-over-year increase of some 10%. The company sells new vehicles, including luxury (BMW, Lexus, Land Rover, and Volvo), mid-line import (Honda, Nissan, and Toyota), and domestic brands (Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors). Its luxury brands generated some 50% of revenues in 2011; while the company's mid-line and domestic brands accounted for about 35% and 15%, respectively.

Strategy

As part of the company's strategic plans, Sonic is primarily focused in growing its operations in metropolitan markets in the Southeast, Southwest, Midwest, and the West (California). The company's long-term growth strategy is to target luxury or mid-line import brands.

Ownership

The Smiths control the company through their ownership of about 75% of Sonic Automotive's voting stock. – less",Investment Analyst,$59K-$126K,Financial analysis Investment evaluation Portfolio management Data analysis,Costa Rica,62186,San Jose

It focuses on exploration and production assets in Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming, and western Canada. In 2011 Devon Energy reported proved reserves of 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent (58% natural gas) and more than 19,900 net acres of assets. It also drilled almost 2,500 gross wells. Devon Energy produces about 2.5 billion cu. ft. of natural gas a day (more than 3% of all the gas consumed in North America). The company is the largest producer and lease holder in the Barnett Shale (Texas) and is looking to replicate its success there to other unconventional plays.

Geographic Reach

Once active in major oil patches worldwide such as Azerbaijan, Brazil, and China, in the mid-2000s the company decided to focus on safer and increasingly productive unconventional onshore exploration opportunities (shales and oil sands) in North America. As a result, Devon Energy has sold all of its international assets.

Financial Analysis

Devon Energy posted a major improvement in revenues in 2010, thanks to higher commodity prices and an increase in production. In 2011, buoyed by record level reserves, high oil prices, and an increased demand for oil and gas products, the company posted a further 15% growth in revenues. Net income only rose by 3%, however, as higher operating, depreciation, deletion, and amortization costs and an increase in deferred income tax expense trimmed income growth.

Boosting its financial resources, in 2012 Devon Energy secured a commitment from Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration & Production for the Chinese company to invest $2.2 billion in exchange for one-third of Devon's interest in five new joint venture plays in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, Niobrara, Mississippian, Ohio Utica Shale, and the Michigan Basin.

That year it also closed a similar $1.4 billion joint venture deal with Sumitomo Corp. to develop 650,000 net acres in the Cline Shale and the Midland-Wolfcamp Shale in West Texas.

Strategy

In 2010 it sold most of its remaining international assets to BP for $7 billion. As part of this deal BP sold undeveloped oil sand leases in Canada to Devon Energy for $500 million and formed a joint venture with the company to exploit them. The company also sold its Panyu field, offshore China, to China National Offshore Oil for $515 million.

Consolidating its North American assets to just its onshore properties, In 2010 Devon Energy sold its stakes in the Cascade, Jack and St. Malo fields in the Gulf of Mexico (about 200 million barrels of estimated recoverable reserves) to AP Moller-Maersk's oil unit for $1.3 billion. It also sold its remaining Gulf of Mexico shelf assets to Apache for $1 billion. – less",Data Scientist,$56K-$107K,"Machine learning algorithms and libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch) Statistical analysis and modeling Data preprocessing and cleaning Big data technologies (e.g., Hadoop, Spark) Data visualization Strong programming skills (Python, R)",Myanmar,176277,Naypyidaw

The regulated utility, a subsidiary of Entergy, distributes electricity to 161,000 residential, commercial, and industrial customers and natural gas to more than 100,000 customers in Orleans Parish, Louisiana; it also owns two generating stations that give it more than 930 MW of generating capacity. 

Entergy New Orleans provides regulated electric and gas utility services to the population of New Orleans.

As a result of the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection a few weeks later; it emerged from bankruptcy in 2007.

After the onslaught of wind and rain caused by Katrina subsided, the city of New Orleans was left crippled and Entergy New Orleans' employees were scrambling to restore power to the city's pumping stations. The company was forced to create an interim headquarters in Clinton, Mississippi (a suburb of Jackson).

The mass evacuation and property damage caused by Hurricane Katrina severely reduced the population served by Entergy New Orleans. Before the big storm it had more than 190,000 electric customers and more than 144,000 gas customers.

The company reported a 10% drop in net revenue in 2011 due to lower electric rates and weak gas prices. However, net income jumped by $4.9 million thanks to lower operational and maintenance expenses, lower taxes, and lower interest expense.

To gain better financial returns, Entergy  plans to spin off its transmission businesses (including Entergy New Orleans') and merge them with a subsidiary of ITC Holdings.

In 2012, as part of a strategy to improve customer relations, Entergy New Orleans introduced a smartphone app to keep customers better informed about company and energy-related matters. – less",Family Nurse Practitioner,$57K-$83K,Family medicine Health assessment Pediatric care Chronic disease management Patient education,French Polynesia,106136,Papeete

CenterPoint Energy's regulated utilities distribute natural gas to 3.3 million customers in six US states and electricity to more than 2 million customers on the Texas Gulf Coast. The company's main stomping ground is Texas, where it has regulated power distribution operations through subsidiary CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric. CenterPoint Energy operates more than 48,230 miles of power distribution lines, 8,000 miles of interstate gas pipeline, and 3,800 miles of gas gathering pipeline. It also provides natural gas field services. 

Operations

The company's natural gas distribution subsidiaries serve customers in Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas. (Texas represented 47% of all natural gas distribution customers in 2010). CenterPoint Energy also markets natural gas and related services to 12,200 commercial, industrial, and wholesale customers located primarily in the eastern US. It also provides HVAC and other energy-related services through its gas division.

Financial Analysis

CenterPoint Energy's sales dropped dramatically in 2009 as the global recession prompted a slump in commodity prices which hurt the performance of its different energy segments. A reviving economy in 2010 led to a stronger demand for power and gas (coupled with rate increases and weather-related spikes in consumption) resulting in a overall jump in revenues and net income that year.

Strategy

CenterPoint Energy's strategy is focused on enhancing and expanding existing core operations, while acquiring complementary and synergistic businesses. In 2011 the company acquired Denver-based natural gas marketing firm Asgard Energy, which supplies gas to agricultural, commercial, industrial, and residential customers in five states (Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, and West Virginia). The acquisition fit into CenterPoint's strategy to expand into the Rockies and diversify into residential choice markets.

In 2012, to add to its midstream assets, CenterPoint Energy Field Services (CEFS), an indirect subsidiary of the company, acquired gathering and processing assets from Prism Gas Systems, a subsidiary of Martin Midstream Partners for $275 million. The assets include Prism's 50% stake in Texas-based Waskom Gas Processing Co. A CEFS subsidiary owns the other 50% stake in Waskom.  – less",Healthcare Business Analyst,$62K-$85K,Healthcare industry knowledge Health data analysis HIPAA regulations EMR systems,Marshall Islands,162215,Majuro

As the primary operating subsidiary of Pacific Mutual Holding Company, Pacific Life offers a wide range of life insurance, asset management, and financial services products, including individual annuities and mutual funds. It also offers a variety of investment products and services for individuals, businesses, and pension plans. Subsidiary Pacific Life & Annuity offers the same mix of life insurance and investment products and services for individuals and businesses in New York. Pacific Life was founded in 1868.

Operations

Pacific Life policyholders are members of parent Pacific Mutual Holding Company, which was created in 1997 following a conversion to the mutual holding company structure. Pacific LifeCorp is the intermediate stock holding company.

While life insurance is the company's bread and butter, it has brought in other operations for variety. Pacific Life's Aviation Capital Group subsidiary leases commercial jets to 90 airlines in more than 40 countries. It also manages aircraft assets for third parties such as commercial airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and financial institutions. Other subsidiaries include Pacific Asset Management, which provides third-party institutional asset management.

Sales & Marketing

Pacific Life's insurance policies are sold through independent distributors and through dealer/broker subsidiary Pacific Select Distributors.

Financial Analysis

The company's growth strategies helped Pacific Life achieve strong results in 2011, with revenues increasing 15% over 2010 to almost 6.7 billion, and net income increasing 29% to $679 million. Its operating income climbed a whopping 40% over 2010 to reach $823 million. The gains achieved were attributed to enhanced service offerings, expanded life insurance, annuity, and mutual fund product offerings, and the two acquisitions made that year.

Strategy

Being a mutual company, Pacific Life operates with a long-term focus to serve in the best interests of its policyholders and clients. in doing so, the company navigated the chilly economic waters of the 2008-2009 recession by steadily introducing new products and building up its capital reserves. By 2010 its net income had grown as risk-weary customers squirreled more of their savings and retirement monies into life insurance and mutual funds.

Mergers, Acquisitions & Divestitures

In 2008 the company added international reinsurance to its portfolio when it acquired the former London-based specialty reinsurance operations of Scottish Re and renamed the business as Pacific Life Re. It then added life retrocession (reinsurance of a reinsurer) to its line-up in 2011 by acquiring that business from Manulife and expanded its business to include the Toronto, Boston, Barbados, and Cologne markets.

Also in 2011 Pacific life bought JPMorgan Chase's pension risk advisory business to form Pacific Global Advisors. The unit offers risk management solutions and advisory services to pension plan sponsors.

The firm divested a noncore business, College Savings Bank, in 2012 to a syndicate of investors for an undisclosed price. The banking unit managed two state-sponsored 529 college savings plans. – less",Interior Designer,$64K-$111K,"Interior design Space planning Color theory Material selection CAD software (e.g., SketchUp) Client collaboration Budget management",Guyana,178765,Georgetown

Its Southern-Owners Insurance subsidiary offers property/casualty insurance in Florida. Auto-Owners Insurance also sells commercial auto, liability, and workers' compensation policies. Established in 1916, the company operates in 26 states nationwide and is represented by more than 6,000 independent agencies.

Geographic Reach

Auto-Owners operates 85 claims, underwriting, and marketing offices in its 26-state service territory. The company's largest markets are Florida and Michigan.

Operations

Auto-Owners' revenues come from insurance premiums, as well as investment income. The company's property/casualty business accounts for about 90% of revenues and 80% of profits, with the remainder coming from premiums and income from the life insurance segment.

Financial Analysis

Auto-Owners reported a 5% increase in net written premiums in 2011 to nearly $5.2 billion, primarily due to growth within the Auto-Owners Insurance, Auto-Owners Life, and Home-Owners Insurance divisions. Total revenues were some $5.7 billion, while net income was reported at $69 million.

Strategy

Auto-Owners is focused on growing its business by establishing strong relationships with independent agents and by diversifying its product offerings. The company has also expanded by adding sales and service facilities in new and existing markets. In 2011 Auto-Owners opened five new branch locations to handle claims in Ashville, North Carolina; Kennesaw, Georgia; Little Rock, Arkansas; Madison, Wisconsin; and Sioux Falls, South Dakota. The Little Rock location also provides underwriting. New construction that year included a backup data center in Traverse City, Michigan, and offices in Broomfield, Colorado, and Columbia, Missouri, to replace existing branches. – less",Brand Director,$57K-$95K,Brand strategy Brand development Creative direction Brand management Market research,"Macedonia, FYR",35011,Skopje

CenterPoint Energy's regulated utilities distribute natural gas to 3.3 million customers in six US states and electricity to more than 2 million customers on the Texas Gulf Coast. The company's main stomping ground is Texas, where it has regulated power distribution operations through subsidiary CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric. CenterPoint Energy operates more than 48,230 miles of power distribution lines, 8,000 miles of interstate gas pipeline, and 3,800 miles of gas gathering pipeline. It also provides natural gas field services. 

Operations

The company's natural gas distribution subsidiaries serve customers in Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas. (Texas represented 47% of all natural gas distribution customers in 2010). CenterPoint Energy also markets natural gas and related services to 12,200 commercial, industrial, and wholesale customers located primarily in the eastern US. It also provides HVAC and other energy-related services through its gas division.

Financial Analysis

CenterPoint Energy's sales dropped dramatically in 2009 as the global recession prompted a slump in commodity prices which hurt the performance of its different energy segments. A reviving economy in 2010 led to a stronger demand for power and gas (coupled with rate increases and weather-related spikes in consumption) resulting in a overall jump in revenues and net income that year.

Strategy

CenterPoint Energy's strategy is focused on enhancing and expanding existing core operations, while acquiring complementary and synergistic businesses. In 2011 the company acquired Denver-based natural gas marketing firm Asgard Energy, which supplies gas to agricultural, commercial, industrial, and residential customers in five states (Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, and West Virginia). The acquisition fit into CenterPoint's strategy to expand into the Rockies and diversify into residential choice markets.

In 2012, to add to its midstream assets, CenterPoint Energy Field Services (CEFS), an indirect subsidiary of the company, acquired gathering and processing assets from Prism Gas Systems, a subsidiary of Martin Midstream Partners for $275 million. The assets include Prism's 50% stake in Texas-based Waskom Gas Processing Co.

The bank is primarily active in the UK, where it has some 1,700 branches, but also has significant retail and commercial operations in Europe, Africa (it owns more than half of South African bank Absa Group), the Middle East, and the US. Barclays Bank offers standard retail services such as deposit accounts and lending, including Woolwich-brand mortgages. The bank also provides commercial money transfer services, insurance products, the Barclaycard line of credit cards, and financial advisory services. Barclays Bank traces its roots to the late 17th century.

Barclays Bank has been building up its portfolio of global credit card accounts, especially as other financial groups sell off noncore units during the economic recovery. In 2010 the company acquired the Italian credit card accounts of Citigroup in a deal that included some 197,000 card accounts and approximately €234 million ($320 million) worth of assets. It previously bought Goldfish, the struggling UK credit card unit of Discover Financial Services, for some £46 million ($70 million). In 2011 Barclays acquired Egg UK's credit card portfolio, which added more than 1 million accounts; it has agreed to buy more Citibank card accounts.

The bank has also been offloading some of its own holdings as part of an overall corporate restructuring. In 2010 Barclays sold its US subprime loan servicing business, HomEq Servicing, to Ocwen Financial. It also announced plans to abandon retail banking in certain international markets and instead focus on wholesale and commercial banking. In 2011 it shuttered its Indonesian retail unit Bank Akita, which it had acquired only two years before. The company also sold its Russian retail and commercial operations to a group of investors, citing difficulties competing in the market. Barclays will instead focus on its investment banking activities in the region.

In 2010 Barclays acquired Standard Life Bank from Standard Life for £226 million ($369 million). The deal added Standard Life's savings and mortgage books to the Barclays fold. Also as part of the deal, Barclays and Standard Life entered into a partnership whereby Barclays markets pension products to its clients.

Despite challenges in the economy, especially in regards to Europe's debt problems, Barclays Bank's revenues grew 8% in 2011. Its Africa business performed relatively strongly, with credit impairments improving, as did Barclaycard, thanks to the portfolio acquisitions which delivered profits. That year the bank closed nearly 150 European branches (largely located in Spain), the costs of which contributed to a 5% decline in net income. – less",Special Education Teacher,$57K-$127K,Special education strategies Individualized education plans (IEPs) Behavior management techniques Collaboration with support staff Special education laws and regulations knowledge,Ecuador,234408,Quito

Its Ameriprise Bank subsidiary offers deposits and loans. Ameriprise, which has about $630 billion of assets under management, distributes its products primarily through a network of more than 9,700 financial advisors.

The company has been sharpening its focus on its branded adviser network. It sold its Securities America independent broker-dealer subsidiary to Ladenburg Thalmann for some $150 million in 2011. Shortly before the sale of the troubled unit, Ameriprise agreed to pay $160 million to settle claims that Securities America brokers sold securities in fraudulent companies.

Ameriprise has been steadily boosting its assets under management and growing its client base (focusing on the affluent and mass affluent with at least $100,000 in investable assets). The company also is focused on geographic areas where those clients are congregated and has closed or consolidated offices in areas with less potential. While Columbia Management covers Ameriprise's main asset management market in the US, the company is increasing its global presence through its Threadneedle brand overseas. Ameriprise plans to grow its asset management operations in Europe, as well as in Australia, the Middle East, and Asia.

Ameriprise's strategies have paid off. Volatile financial market conditions, which negatively impacted all of the company's operations, led to a decline in revenue in 2008 and 2009. However, the company returned to success in 2010 and revenues grew by more than 20% that year. Poor economic conditions continued in 2011. However, Ameriprise's operating net revenues climbed that year by about 10%. The boost was due to strong growth in the company's fee-based advisory and asset management businesses.

It also engages in natural gas compressing, treating, processing, transporting, and selling. DCP Midstream LLC also transports and sells NGLs and distributes propane wholesale. The company operates natural gas gathering systems (5,300 miles of pipe) in eight states (including Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas), seven processing plants, four NGL pipelines, and nine propane storage terminals. Spectra Energy holds a 50% holding in DCP (ConocoPhillips holds the other 50%).

A consolidator in the fragmented natural gas gathering, NGLs, and wholesale propane industry segments, the company has been expanding its gas supply base and its propane wholesale network in recent years through strategic complementary acquisitions and joint ventures.

In 2012 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Texas-based Crossroads processing plant and gathering system from Penn Virginia Resource Partners for $63 million. The bolt-on acquisition allows the company to expand its market position in East Texas and provide services to drillers in the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley regions.

In 2011 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Seaway Products Pipeline Co. from ConocoPhillips. The pipeline, now called Southern Hills Pipeline and being converted to NGL service, is expected to be operational by mid-2013. It will provide NGL access from the Midcontinent to the Texas Gulf Coast.

The company agreed to form a joint venture with EQT Corporation to develop natural gas processing and related natural gas liquid (NGL) infrastructure in the Marcellus and Huron shale plays in the Appalachian basin. (However, the parties could not come to agreement and dropped the plan in early 2011). In 2010, the company acquired the Liberty gathering system and south Raywood processing plant from Ceritas Energy in southeast Texas. The pipeline system interconnects with DCP Midstream's Centana Intrastate Pipeline system.

Expanding in Michigan, in 2009 the company acquired gas gathering and treating assets for $45.1 million. In 2010 it acquired a 350-mile interstate natural gas liquids pipeline system in Colorado's Denver-Julesburg Basin from Buckeye Partners for $22 million.

In 2010 DCP Midstream Partners moved to extend its Northeast wholesale propane business into the MidAtlantic region, acquiring UGI's Atlantic Energy for $49 million. That year it also purchased of NGL storage company Marysville Hydrocarbon Holdings (in Michigan) for about $95 million.

Although DCP Midstream Partners' revenues suffered in 2009 as a result of the global recession and lower commodity prices, acquisitions and organic growth managed to offset lower natural gas volumes.  Acquisitions, increased demand, higher commodity and propane prices, and gains on derivatives help to lift the company's revenues and net income in 2010.

In terms of the company's origins, the D in DCP Midstream Partners (formerly Duke Energy Field Services) is for Duke Energy; the CP, ConocoPhillips. These two energy majors formed DCP Midstream Partners in 2005. Following the spinoff of Spectra Energy from Duke Energy in 2007, Spectra Energy assumed Duke Energy's 50% holding in DCP. – less",Quality Control Manager,$60K-$98K,"Quality control processes and methodologies Statistical process control (SPC) Root cause analysis and corrective action Quality management systems (e.g., ISO 9001) Compliance and regulatory knowledge",Barbados,25907,Bridgetown

CenterPoint Energy's regulated utilities distribute natural gas to 3.3 million customers in six US states and electricity to more than 2 million customers on the Texas Gulf Coast. The company's main stomping ground is Texas, where it has regulated power distribution operations through subsidiary CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric. CenterPoint Energy operates more than 48,230 miles of power distribution lines, 8,000 miles of interstate gas pipeline, and 3,800 miles of gas gathering pipeline. It also provides natural gas field services. 

Operations

The company's natural gas distribution subsidiaries serve customers in Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas. (Texas represented 47% of all natural gas distribution customers in 2010). CenterPoint Energy also markets natural gas and related services to 12,200 commercial, industrial, and wholesale customers located primarily in the eastern US. It also provides HVAC and other energy-related services through its gas division.

Financial Analysis

CenterPoint Energy's sales dropped dramatically in 2009 as the global recession prompted a slump in commodity prices which hurt the performance of its different energy segments. A reviving economy in 2010 led to a stronger demand for power and gas (coupled with rate increases and weather-related spikes in consumption) resulting in a overall jump in revenues and net income that year.

Strategy

CenterPoint Energy's strategy is focused on enhancing and expanding existing core operations, while acquiring complementary and synergistic businesses. In 2011 the company acquired Denver-based natural gas marketing firm Asgard Energy, which supplies gas to agricultural, commercial, industrial, and residential customers in five states (Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, and West Virginia). The acquisition fit into CenterPoint's strategy to expand into the Rockies and diversify into residential choice markets.

In 2012, to add to its midstream assets, CenterPoint Energy Field Services (CEFS), an indirect subsidiary of the company, acquired gathering and processing assets from Prism Gas Systems, a subsidiary of Martin Midstream Partners for $275 million. The assets include Prism's 50% stake in Texas-based Waskom Gas Processing Co.

The company offers financial planning, products, and services to individual and institutional investors. Through Ameriprise Financial, Columbia Management, RiverSource, and other affiliates and brands, the company provides access to insurance, mutual funds, savings plans, personal trust services, retail brokerage, and other financial products and services. Its Ameriprise Bank subsidiary offers deposits and loans. Ameriprise, which has about $630 billion of assets under management, distributes its products primarily through a network of more than 9,700 financial advisors.

The company has been sharpening its focus on its branded adviser network. It sold its Securities America independent broker-dealer subsidiary to Ladenburg Thalmann for some $150 million in 2011. Shortly before the sale of the troubled unit, Ameriprise agreed to pay $160 million to settle claims that Securities America brokers sold securities in fraudulent companies.

Ameriprise has been steadily boosting its assets under management and growing its client base (focusing on the affluent and mass affluent with at least $100,000 in investable assets). The company also is focused on geographic areas where those clients are congregated and has closed or consolidated offices in areas with less potential. While Columbia Management covers Ameriprise's main asset management market in the US, the company is increasing its global presence through its Threadneedle brand overseas. Ameriprise plans to grow its asset management operations in Europe, as well as in Australia, the Middle East, and Asia.

Ameriprise's strategies have paid off. Volatile financial market conditions, which negatively impacted all of the company's operations, led to a decline in revenue in 2008 and 2009. However, the company returned to success in 2010 and revenues grew by more than 20% that year. Poor economic conditions continued in 2011. However, Ameriprise's operating net revenues climbed that year by about 10%. The boost was due to strong growth in the company's fee-based advisory and asset management businesses.

The company’s applications and technologies are an integral part of products used in every major market and industry.
With operations in more than 50 countries and 25,000 employees worldwide, Avery Dennison serves customers with insights and innovations that help make brands more inspiring and the world more intelligent.
Avery Dennison Corporation (NYSE: AVY) is a Fortune 500® company with sales of $6 billion from continuing operations in 2015. We are based in Glendale, California.

The Avery Dennison story begins in 1935, with just a few spare parts, one very bright idea and a $100 loan.

Ray Stanton (“Stan”) Avery, a struggling clerk in Los Angeles, invented a smarter way for stores to price their products, then went on to pioneer the labeling industry.

With a few simple materials—primarily used machine parts and a saber saw—Stan created and patented the first self-adhesive, die-cut labeling machine. His practical genius would ultimately yield eighteen patents and establish Avery Adhesives as the company that transformed how brands and businesses deliver information. In 1990, Avery International merged with Dennison Manufacturing to become Avery Dennison.

Today, we manufacture and distribute labeling and packaging materials in over 50 countries and employ more than 25,000 people. The flexibility and responsiveness afforded by our company's global footprint enables us to service our customers at key points throughout their supply chain.

In just over 80 years we have grown from one bright idea into a global corporation that continues to set new standards for quality and innovation in materials science.

Avery Dennison manufactures and distributes display graphics, labeling and packaging materials, retail graphic embellishments and RFID tags that companies around the world use to engage customers and efficiently manage their inventories. Our products are virtually everywhere you look, providing a crucial thread in the fabric of global commerce.

We sustain Stan Avery's spirit of curiosity through research, invention and development of new materials science products and processes. Our expertise in high-speed manufacturing, information display and management, logistics, branding, graphics and packaging enables us to impact a wide array of markets—from consumer packaged goods and apparel to transportation, architecture and healthcare.

We strive to make each customer's brand more inspiring and every process more intelligent.

Avery Dennison's extensive experience in our core businesses allows us to purchase, process, and deliver needed materials to key points in our customers' supply chains with rapid and globally consistent execution.

In the 21st century, the company will expand its footprint in emerging markets.

The pursuit of this vision has compelled us to align our businesses into a focused, customer-driven company that specializes in materials science. Our in-depth pool of expertise and global scale enable us to deliver insights, innovative products and intelligent solutions to customers all over the world. – less",Sales Account Manager,$61K-$126K,Account management Sales strategy Negotiation and closing skills,Bolivia,212316,Sucre (de jure)

We are a leading, multi-category consumer goods company that provides tobacco and nicotine products to hundreds of millions of adult consumers worldwide.

For decades, we have built our business on successfully meeting the preferences of adult smokers with world-famous cigarette brands, superior blends and market-leading innovations.

We have been satisfying consumers, delivering shareholder value and creating valued employment for over a century. However, we are entering the most dynamic period of change our industry has ever encountered.

An unprecedented confluence of technology, societal change and public health awareness has created a unique opportunity: the opportunity to make a substantial leap forward in our long-held ambition to provide our consumers with potentially reduced-risk tobacco and nicotine choices.

Our acquisition of Reynolds American Inc. (RAI) in July 2017, which has transformed both the scale and geographic reach of our business and our portfolio of potentially reduced-risk products, now positions us perfectly to capitalise on this ambition.

We call this ambition Transforming Tobacco and we are fully committed to leading this transformation.


The way our people operate is embodied in our four Guiding Principles: Enterprising Spirit, Freedom Through Responsibility, Open Minded and Strength from Diversity. These principles underpin our culture and guide how we deliver our strategy.

The culture of the Group is about developing talent from within, stretching and supporting the high performing managers who will lead the delivery of our strategy. In 2017, over 92% of our senior appointments were drawn from people already within the business – moves that have helped deliver stronger and more diverse leadership teams.

Our employer brand – ‘Bring your Difference’ – has a strong presence across social media channels, including LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram. We are leading our industry in social media engagement and have moved ahead of several top FMCG companies.

Providing a safe place to work, protecting our employees’ wellbeing and listening to their views are also fundamental.

As the primary operating subsidiary of Pacific Mutual Holding Company, Pacific Life offers a wide range of life insurance, asset management, and financial services products, including individual annuities and mutual funds. It also offers a variety of investment products and services for individuals, businesses, and pension plans. Subsidiary Pacific Life & Annuity offers the same mix of life insurance and investment products and services for individuals and businesses in New York. Pacific Life was founded in 1868.

Operations

Pacific Life policyholders are members of parent Pacific Mutual Holding Company, which was created in 1997 following a conversion to the mutual holding company structure. Pacific LifeCorp is the intermediate stock holding company.

While life insurance is the company's bread and butter, it has brought in other operations for variety. Pacific Life's Aviation Capital Group subsidiary leases commercial jets to 90 airlines in more than 40 countries. It also manages aircraft assets for third parties such as commercial airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and financial institutions. Other subsidiaries include Pacific Asset Management, which provides third-party institutional asset management.

Sales & Marketing

Pacific Life's insurance policies are sold through independent distributors and through dealer/broker subsidiary Pacific Select Distributors.

Financial Analysis

The company's growth strategies helped Pacific Life achieve strong results in 2011, with revenues increasing 15% over 2010 to almost 6.7 billion, and net income increasing 29% to $679 million. Its operating income climbed a whopping 40% over 2010 to reach $823 million. The gains achieved were attributed to enhanced service offerings, expanded life insurance, annuity, and mutual fund product offerings, and the two acquisitions made that year.

Strategy

Being a mutual company, Pacific Life operates with a long-term focus to serve in the best interests of its policyholders and clients. in doing so, the company navigated the chilly economic waters of the 2008-2009 recession by steadily introducing new products and building up its capital reserves. By 2010 its net income had grown as risk-weary customers squirreled more of their savings and retirement monies into life insurance and mutual funds.

Mergers, Acquisitions & Divestitures

In 2008 the company added international reinsurance to its portfolio when it acquired the former London-based specialty reinsurance operations of Scottish Re and renamed the business as Pacific Life Re. It then added life retrocession (reinsurance of a reinsurer) to its line-up in 2011 by acquiring that business from Manulife and expanded its business to include the Toronto, Boston, Barbados, and Cologne markets.

Also in 2011 Pacific life bought JPMorgan Chase's pension risk advisory business to form Pacific Global Advisors. The unit offers risk management solutions and advisory services to pension plan sponsors.

The firm divested a noncore business, College Savings Bank, in 2012 to a syndicate of investors for an undisclosed price.

The company's primary operations include the manufacture of building block chemicals like acetic acid and vinyl acetate monomers. Those chemicals are used in everything from inks and paints to agricultural products and chewing gum. Canadian subsidiary Acetex, the majority of whose sales come from Europe, is the world's largest acetyls manufacturer. Other products include acetate tow (in cigarette filters); industrial specialties like ethylene vinyl aceta; and engineered plastics. The bulk of sales come from the US and Germany. 

Operations

Celanese operates through four business segments: Advanced Engineered Materials, Consumer Specialties, Industrial Specialties, and Acetyl Intermediates. The company is one of the world's largest producers of acetyl products, as well as a top global producer of engineered polymers.

Geographic Reach

In addition to manufacturing sites in the US, it also has properties, plants, and equipment in Belgium, China, Canada, Germany, Mexico, and Singapore.

Financial Analysis

Celanese continued its recovery from the recession of 2008-09 with a 14% increase in revenues in 2011, due primarily to higher volumes and increased sales prices across most of its business segments. The largest gains were in its Industrial Specialties unit (up 18%), Advanced Engineered Materials unit (up 17%), and its Acetyl Intermediates segment (up 15%). Net income grew by 61% in 2011, as increased revenues outpaced a more modest growth in operating expenses.

Strategy

Celanese's strategy is to grow the company through expansion into emerging regions, particularly China; to offer innovation through developing new products and applications; increase its productivity through energy reduction, business process improvements, and manufacturing optimization; and boost its portfolio by growing its business through both acquisitions or internal growth.

In 2012 the company teamed up with Indonesia's Pertamina, forming a joint venture to develop fuel ethanol projects in that country.

To grow its emulsion polymers business, in 2011 the company acquired two product lines, Vinac and Flexbond, from Ashland. The acquisition is expected to speed up growth of the company's emulsion polymers operations throughout the Americas -- especially in the adhesives, textiles, coatings, and paper segments.

Celanese subsidiary Ticona Engineering Polymers acquired two product lines, Zenite liquid crystal polymer and Thermx polycyclohexylene-dimethylene terephthalate, from DuPont Performance Polymers division in 2010. The units expanded Celanese's offerings in the electrical and electronics application segments of the global polymers market. 

Ownership

In 2012 Capital Research Global Investors owned about 11% of Celanese, with several other investment firms owning a smaller stakes.

Company Background

Celanese Corporation was created in 2004 by the Blackstone Group, which had acquired a majority share in Celanese AG, turned it private, and then flipped it in a 2005 public offering. Blackstone finally divested its remaining holdings in Celanese in 2007. – less",Geriatric Physical Therapist,$64K-$97K,Geriatric rehabilitation Fall prevention Elderly patient care,Eswatini,80593,Mbabane

The company’s applications and technologies are an integral part of products used in every major market and industry.
With operations in more than 50 countries and 25,000 employees worldwide, Avery Dennison serves customers with insights and innovations that help make brands more inspiring and the world more intelligent.
Avery Dennison Corporation (NYSE: AVY) is a Fortune 500® company with sales of $6 billion from continuing operations in 2015. We are based in Glendale, California.

The Avery Dennison story begins in 1935, with just a few spare parts, one very bright idea and a $100 loan.

Ray Stanton (“Stan”) Avery, a struggling clerk in Los Angeles, invented a smarter way for stores to price their products, then went on to pioneer the labeling industry.

With a few simple materials—primarily used machine parts and a saber saw—Stan created and patented the first self-adhesive, die-cut labeling machine. His practical genius would ultimately yield eighteen patents and establish Avery Adhesives as the company that transformed how brands and businesses deliver information. In 1990, Avery International merged with Dennison Manufacturing to become Avery Dennison.

Today, we manufacture and distribute labeling and packaging materials in over 50 countries and employ more than 25,000 people. The flexibility and responsiveness afforded by our company's global footprint enables us to service our customers at key points throughout their supply chain.

In just over 80 years we have grown from one bright idea into a global corporation that continues to set new standards for quality and innovation in materials science.

Avery Dennison manufactures and distributes display graphics, labeling and packaging materials, retail graphic embellishments and RFID tags that companies around the world use to engage customers and efficiently manage their inventories. Our products are virtually everywhere you look, providing a crucial thread in the fabric of global commerce.

We sustain Stan Avery's spirit of curiosity through research, invention and development of new materials science products and processes. Our expertise in high-speed manufacturing, information display and management, logistics, branding, graphics and packaging enables us to impact a wide array of markets—from consumer packaged goods and apparel to transportation, architecture and healthcare.

We strive to make each customer's brand more inspiring and every process more intelligent.

Avery Dennison's extensive experience in our core businesses allows us to purchase, process, and deliver needed materials to key points in our customers' supply chains with rapid and globally consistent execution.

In the 21st century, the company will expand its footprint in emerging markets.

The pursuit of this vision has compelled us to align our businesses into a focused, customer-driven company that specializes in materials science. Our in-depth pool of expertise and global scale enable us to deliver insights, innovative products and intelligent solutions to customers all over the world. – less",Clinical Nurse Specialist,$64K-$85K,"Clinical nursing specialization (e.g., critical care, oncology) Advanced nursing skills Patient education",Antigua and Barbuda,212392,Saint John's

Progressive people work hard to keep us at the top of our industry, and are rewarded for it—with competitive pay, great benefits, the possibility of bonuses based on company performance, work-life balance opportunities, on-site fitness and health centers, and other special perks.

And we know that cultivating a diverse, inclusive, and flexible work environment is critical to our achievements. That’s why we promote from within, work hard and get rewarded for it, and win the right way.

The holding company distributes electricity to 2.4 million customers and natural gas to 900,000 customers in Missouri and Illinois through utility subsidiaries. Ameren has a generating capacity of 16,000 MW (primarily coal-fired), most of which is controlled by utility Union Electric (which does business as Ameren Missouri) and nonregulated subsidiary AmerenEnergy Resources Generating Company. Ameren, which also supplies merchant generation power to third parties, operates a nuclear power facility, three hydroelectric plants, and several coal-fired plants and turbine combustion facilities. It also purchases power, including windpower.

Operations

In addition to operating power plants, Ameren procures natural gas for its affiliated companies, builds new power plants, and provides long-term energy supply contracts. It also markets and trades electricity to wholesale and retail customers and provides risk management and other energy-related services.

Financial Analysis

Ameren's overall revenues dipped in 2011. While increased rates helped to lift Ameren Missouri's revenues in 2011, Ameren Illinois' regulated segment and the merchant generation segment both reported a drop in revenues. In particular, low gas prices and a warm winter hurt gas revenues. However, lower purchased power and resale gas, coupled with a drop in goodwill, impairment, and other charges, helped to lift Ameren's net income for the year.

Favorable weather conditions (which increased energy demand) and rate increases help to lift the company's revenues in 2010. However, impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets in the merchant generation segment (due to the sustained decline in market prices for electricity) dragged down Ameren's operating income.

Strategy

In 2010 the company combined AmerenIP, AmerenCIPS, and AmerenCILCO into one entity, Ameren Illinois, in order to streamline operations and reduce confusion among customers. The three Illinois utilities have operated as a single business since 2004 and deliver energy to more than 1,100 communities. Ameren Illinois also operates some 21,400 miles of natural gas distribution and transmission lines.

To comply with federal requirements to separate ownership of power generation and transmission businesses, the operations of Ameren subsidiaries' transmission assets are under the control ofMidwest Independent Transmission System Operator, a regional transmission organization that coordinates power across 15 Midwestern states and one Canadian Province.  – less",Financial Planning Manager,$61K-$112K,Financial planning Investment strategies Team leadership Wealth management Client advisory skills,British Virgin Islands,101430,Road Town

The company's primary operations include the manufacture of building block chemicals like acetic acid and vinyl acetate monomers. Those chemicals are used in everything from inks and paints to agricultural products and chewing gum. Canadian subsidiary Acetex, the majority of whose sales come from Europe, is the world's largest acetyls manufacturer. Other products include acetate tow (in cigarette filters); industrial specialties like ethylene vinyl aceta; and engineered plastics. The bulk of sales come from the US and Germany. 

Operations

Celanese operates through four business segments: Advanced Engineered Materials, Consumer Specialties, Industrial Specialties, and Acetyl Intermediates. The company is one of the world's largest producers of acetyl products, as well as a top global producer of engineered polymers.

Geographic Reach

In addition to manufacturing sites in the US, it also has properties, plants, and equipment in Belgium, China, Canada, Germany, Mexico, and Singapore.

Financial Analysis

Celanese continued its recovery from the recession of 2008-09 with a 14% increase in revenues in 2011, due primarily to higher volumes and increased sales prices across most of its business segments. The largest gains were in its Industrial Specialties unit (up 18%), Advanced Engineered Materials unit (up 17%), and its Acetyl Intermediates segment (up 15%). Net income grew by 61% in 2011, as increased revenues outpaced a more modest growth in operating expenses.

Strategy

Celanese's strategy is to grow the company through expansion into emerging regions, particularly China; to offer innovation through developing new products and applications; increase its productivity through energy reduction, business process improvements, and manufacturing optimization; and boost its portfolio by growing its business through both acquisitions or internal growth.

In 2012 the company teamed up with Indonesia's Pertamina, forming a joint venture to develop fuel ethanol projects in that country.

To grow its emulsion polymers business, in 2011 the company acquired two product lines, Vinac and Flexbond, from Ashland. The acquisition is expected to speed up growth of the company's emulsion polymers operations throughout the Americas -- especially in the adhesives, textiles, coatings, and paper segments.

Celanese subsidiary Ticona Engineering Polymers acquired two product lines, Zenite liquid crystal polymer and Thermx polycyclohexylene-dimethylene terephthalate, from DuPont Performance Polymers division in 2010. The units expanded Celanese's offerings in the electrical and electronics application segments of the global polymers market. 

Ownership

In 2012 Capital Research Global Investors owned about 11% of Celanese, with several other investment firms owning a smaller stakes.

Company Background

Celanese Corporation was created in 2004 by the Blackstone Group, which had acquired a majority share in Celanese AG, turned it private, and then flipped it in a 2005 public offering. Blackstone finally divested its remaining holdings in Celanese in 2007. – less",Surgical Physician Assistant,$65K-$85K,Surgical procedures and techniques Operating room protocols Anesthesia management,Estonia,81527,Tallinn

As the primary operating subsidiary of Pacific Mutual Holding Company, Pacific Life offers a wide range of life insurance, asset management, and financial services products, including individual annuities and mutual funds. It also offers a variety of investment products and services for individuals, businesses, and pension plans. Subsidiary Pacific Life & Annuity offers the same mix of life insurance and investment products and services for individuals and businesses in New York. Pacific Life was founded in 1868.

Operations

Pacific Life policyholders are members of parent Pacific Mutual Holding Company, which was created in 1997 following a conversion to the mutual holding company structure. Pacific LifeCorp is the intermediate stock holding company.

While life insurance is the company's bread and butter, it has brought in other operations for variety. Pacific Life's Aviation Capital Group subsidiary leases commercial jets to 90 airlines in more than 40 countries. It also manages aircraft assets for third parties such as commercial airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and financial institutions. Other subsidiaries include Pacific Asset Management, which provides third-party institutional asset management.

Sales & Marketing

Pacific Life's insurance policies are sold through independent distributors and through dealer/broker subsidiary Pacific Select Distributors.

Financial Analysis

The company's growth strategies helped Pacific Life achieve strong results in 2011, with revenues increasing 15% over 2010 to almost 6.7 billion, and net income increasing 29% to $679 million. Its operating income climbed a whopping 40% over 2010 to reach $823 million. The gains achieved were attributed to enhanced service offerings, expanded life insurance, annuity, and mutual fund product offerings, and the two acquisitions made that year.

Strategy

Being a mutual company, Pacific Life operates with a long-term focus to serve in the best interests of its policyholders and clients. in doing so, the company navigated the chilly economic waters of the 2008-2009 recession by steadily introducing new products and building up its capital reserves. By 2010 its net income had grown as risk-weary customers squirreled more of their savings and retirement monies into life insurance and mutual funds.

Mergers, Acquisitions & Divestitures

In 2008 the company added international reinsurance to its portfolio when it acquired the former London-based specialty reinsurance operations of Scottish Re and renamed the business as Pacific Life Re.

The holding company distributes electricity to 2.4 million customers and natural gas to 900,000 customers in Missouri and Illinois through utility subsidiaries. Ameren has a generating capacity of 16,000 MW (primarily coal-fired), most of which is controlled by utility Union Electric (which does business as Ameren Missouri) and nonregulated subsidiary AmerenEnergy Resources Generating Company. Ameren, which also supplies merchant generation power to third parties, operates a nuclear power facility, three hydroelectric plants, and several coal-fired plants and turbine combustion facilities. It also purchases power, including windpower.

Operations

In addition to operating power plants, Ameren procures natural gas for its affiliated companies, builds new power plants, and provides long-term energy supply contracts. It also markets and trades electricity to wholesale and retail customers and provides risk management and other energy-related services.

Financial Analysis

Ameren's overall revenues dipped in 2011. While increased rates helped to lift Ameren Missouri's revenues in 2011, Ameren Illinois' regulated segment and the merchant generation segment both reported a drop in revenues. In particular, low gas prices and a warm winter hurt gas revenues. However, lower purchased power and resale gas, coupled with a drop in goodwill, impairment, and other charges, helped to lift Ameren's net income for the year.

Favorable weather conditions (which increased energy demand) and rate increases help to lift the company's revenues in 2010. However, impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets in the merchant generation segment (due to the sustained decline in market prices for electricity) dragged down Ameren's operating income.

In 2010 the company combined AmerenIP, AmerenCIPS, and AmerenCILCO into one entity, Ameren Illinois, in order to streamline operations and reduce confusion among customers.

With operations in more than 50 countries and 25,000 employees worldwide, Avery Dennison serves customers with insights and innovations that help make brands more inspiring and the world more intelligent.
Avery Dennison Corporation (NYSE: AVY) is a Fortune 500® company with sales of $6 billion from continuing operations in 2015. We are based in Glendale, California.

The Avery Dennison story begins in 1935, with just a few spare parts, one very bright idea and a $100 loan.

Ray Stanton (“Stan”) Avery, a struggling clerk in Los Angeles, invented a smarter way for stores to price their products, then went on to pioneer the labeling industry.

With a few simple materials—primarily used machine parts and a saber saw—Stan created and patented the first self-adhesive, die-cut labeling machine. His practical genius would ultimately yield eighteen patents and establish Avery Adhesives as the company that transformed how brands and businesses deliver information. In 1990, Avery International merged with Dennison Manufacturing to become Avery Dennison.

Today, we manufacture and distribute labeling and packaging materials in over 50 countries and employ more than 25,000 people. The flexibility and responsiveness afforded by our company's global footprint enables us to service our customers at key points throughout their supply chain.

In just over 80 years we have grown from one bright idea into a global corporation that continues to set new standards for quality and innovation in materials science.

Avery Dennison manufactures and distributes display graphics, labeling and packaging materials, retail graphic embellishments and RFID tags that companies around the world use to engage customers and efficiently manage their inventories. Our products are virtually everywhere you look, providing a crucial thread in the fabric of global commerce.

We sustain Stan Avery's spirit of curiosity through research, invention and development of new materials science products and processes. Our expertise in high-speed manufacturing, information display and management, logistics, branding, graphics and packaging enables us to impact a wide array of markets—from consumer packaged goods and apparel to transportation, architecture and healthcare.

We strive to make each customer's brand more inspiring and every process more intelligent.

Avery Dennison's extensive experience in our core businesses allows us to purchase, process, and deliver needed materials to key points in our customers' supply chains with rapid and globally consistent execution.

In the 21st century, the company will expand its footprint in emerging markets.

The pursuit of this vision has compelled us to align our businesses into a focused, customer-driven company that specializes in materials science. Our in-depth pool of expertise and global scale enable us to deliver insights, innovative products and intelligent solutions to customers all over the world. – less",Account Manager,$61K-$104K,Account management Customer relationship management Sales and negotiation Business development Client needs analysis,New Caledonia,212480,Noumea

A part of top US power firm Duke Energy, the regulated utility provides electricity services to about 2.4 million customers in North and South Carolina. Operating in a 24,000-square mile service territory, Duke Energy Carolinas has 101,400 miles of distribution cable. Its transmission system spans 13,100 miles. The utility has a net generating capacity of about 19,200 MW from interests in fossil-fueled, nuclear, and hydroelectric power plants. Duke Energy Carolinas also sells power to wholesale customers.

The utility's three nuclear plants account for more than a quarter of Duke Energy Carolinas' generating capacity.

Duke Energy Carolinas is investing $7 billion from 2010 to 2012 to expand its generating capacity and maintain its nuclear fuel and plants. By 2020 the company is looking to expand capacity by 5,400 MW, a strategy that brings new plants online while replacing older, less efficient ones.

The global recession produced weaker demand for power (especially from industrial customers) which lowered company revenues in 2009. However, the same downturn cut fuel expenses (including purchased power from third parties) resulting in only a slight dip in Duke Energy Carolinas' operating income.

In 2010 the company saw its revenues rise, primarily due to new retail electric base rates in North Carolina and South Carolina, and favorable weather conditions which spurred demand. Duke Energy Carolinas also posted higher net income, despite an increase in fuel costs and expenses related to an employee voluntary severance plan. – less",Customer Support Specialist,$64K-$89K,Customer service Problem-solving Communication skills Ticketing system usage Product knowledge,Cameroon,4794,Yaounde

In addition to auto coverage, the company provides a range of personal property/casualty and life insurance products to more than 3 million policyholders. Auto-Owners Insurance Group operates through subsidiaries including Auto-Owners Life Insurance, Home-Owners Insurance, and Property-Owners Insurance Company. Its Southern-Owners Insurance subsidiary offers property/casualty insurance in Florida. Auto-Owners Insurance also sells commercial auto, liability, and workers' compensation policies. Established in 1916, the company operates in 26 states nationwide and is represented by more than 6,000 independent agencies.

Geographic Reach

Auto-Owners operates 85 claims, underwriting, and marketing offices in its 26-state service territory. The company's largest markets are Florida and Michigan.

Operations

Auto-Owners' revenues come from insurance premiums, as well as investment income. The company's property/casualty business accounts for about 90% of revenues and 80% of profits, with the remainder coming from premiums and income from the life insurance segment.

Financial Analysis

Auto-Owners reported a 5% increase in net written premiums in 2011 to nearly $5.2 billion, primarily due to growth within the Auto-Owners Insurance, Auto-Owners Life, and Home-Owners Insurance divisions. Total revenues were some $5.7 billion, while net income was reported at $69 million.

Strategy

Auto-Owners is focused on growing its business by establishing strong relationships with independent agents and by diversifying its product offerings. The company has also expanded by adding sales and service facilities in new and existing markets. In 2011 Auto-Owners opened five new branch locations to handle claims in Ashville, North Carolina; Kennesaw, Georgia; Little Rock, Arkansas; Madison, Wisconsin; and Sioux Falls, South Dakota. The Little Rock location also provides underwriting. New construction that year included a backup data center in Traverse City, Michigan, and offices in Broomfield, Colorado, and Columbia, Missouri, to replace existing branches. – less",Frontend Developer,$63K-$102K,"Proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Experience with frontend frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js Responsive web design Cross-browser compatibility Version control (e.g., Git) Frontend performance optimization",Ireland,35155,Dublin

The company offers financial planning, products, and services to individual and institutional investors. Through Ameriprise Financial, Columbia Management, RiverSource, and other affiliates and brands, the company provides access to insurance, mutual funds, savings plans, personal trust services, retail brokerage, and other financial products and services. Its Ameriprise Bank subsidiary offers deposits and loans. Ameriprise, which has about $630 billion of assets under management, distributes its products primarily through a network of more than 9,700 financial advisors.

The company has been sharpening its focus on its branded adviser network. It sold its Securities America independent broker-dealer subsidiary to Ladenburg Thalmann for some $150 million in 2011. Shortly before the sale of the troubled unit, Ameriprise agreed to pay $160 million to settle claims that Securities America brokers sold securities in fraudulent companies.

Ameriprise has been steadily boosting its assets under management and growing its client base (focusing on the affluent and mass affluent with at least $100,000 in investable assets). The company also is focused on geographic areas where those clients are congregated and has closed or consolidated offices in areas with less potential. While Columbia Management covers Ameriprise's main asset management market in the US, the company is increasing its global presence through its Threadneedle brand overseas. Ameriprise plans to grow its asset management operations in Europe, as well as in Australia, the Middle East, and Asia.

Ameriprise's strategies have paid off. Volatile financial market conditions, which negatively impacted all of the company's operations, led to a decline in revenue in 2008 and 2009. However, the company returned to success in 2010 and revenues grew by more than 20% that year. Poor economic conditions continued in 2011. However, Ameriprise's operating net revenues climbed that year by about 10%. The boost was due to strong growth in the company's fee-based advisory and asset management businesses.

The gains achieved were attributed to enhanced service offerings, expanded life insurance, annuity, and mutual fund product offerings, and the two acquisitions made that year.

Strategy

Being a mutual company, Pacific Life operates with a long-term focus to serve in the best interests of its policyholders and clients. in doing so, the company navigated the chilly economic waters of the 2008-2009 recession by steadily introducing new products and building up its capital reserves. By 2010 its net income had grown as risk-weary customers squirreled more of their savings and retirement monies into life insurance and mutual funds.

Mergers, Acquisitions & Divestitures

In 2008 the company added international reinsurance to its portfolio when it acquired the former London-based specialty reinsurance operations of Scottish Re and renamed the business as Pacific Life Re. It then added life retrocession (reinsurance of a reinsurer) to its line-up in 2011 by acquiring that business from Manulife and expanded its business to include the Toronto, Boston, Barbados, and Cologne markets.

Also in 2011 Pacific life bought JPMorgan Chase's pension risk advisory business to form Pacific Global Advisors. The unit offers risk management solutions and advisory services to pension plan sponsors.

The firm divested a noncore business, College Savings Bank, in 2012 to a syndicate of investors for an undisclosed price. The banking unit managed two state-sponsored 529 college savings plans. – less",Market Researcher,$61K-$98K,Market research methodologies Data collection and analysis Industry knowledge,Gambia,178802,Banjul

Western Digital,"{'Work Happiness Score': '69', 'Achievement': '79', 'Appreciation': '74', 'Flexibility': '74', 'Learning': '73', 'Purpose': '71', 'Trust': '69', 'Compensation': '69', 'Support': '69', 'Inclusion': '68', 'Energy': '67', 'Belonging': '66', 'Management': '65'}",3.8,"When it comes to data storage, Western Digital has drive. The company is one of the largest independent makers of hard-disk drives, which record, store, and recall volumes of data. Drives for PCs account for most of Western Digital's sales, although the company also makes devices used in servers, cloud computing data centers, and home entertainment products such as set-top boxes and video game consoles. The company sells to manufacturers and through retailers and distributors. More than 60% of its sales are to OEMs such as  Hewlett-Packard, which is Western Digital's largest customer. The company gets more than half of its sales from the Asia/Pacific region.

Operations

Western Digital is structured around two subsidiaries: WD Technologies and Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST). Each subsidiary maintains its own brand and product lines, with separate sales, marketing, operations, and product development teams. The company is looking to offer improved customer experiences for competing and complementary brands, while finding efficiencies in shared services.

Geographic Reach

The company is seeing strong growth in Asia (which represents more than 55% of sales) and the US (nearly 20%), with slower growth in the EMEA region (another nearly 20%). Western Digital has manufacturing facilities in the US and across Asia and sales offices worldwide.

Strategy

Western Digital is one of a handful of manufacturers that dominate the hard-disk drive market -- a sector characterized by harsh competition, short product life cycles, and aggressive price cuts. In order to reduce its dependence on drives for PCs, the company has branched into branded consumer media devices, including DVR expanders, portable media drives, and media players that let users play data from external drives on TV. Its WD TV Live Plus media player streams movies (including those offered by Netflix) and Internet video to a digital TV. It is also investing in products for the mobile computing and cloud computing markets.

Another promising market for Western Digital is nearline hard drives, which are more cost effective than traditional hard drives by providing more capacity while requiring lower power. Nearline hard drives are used for stimulated applications, such as video surveillance and medical imaging, and IT infrastructure applications, including scientific computing and Web search engines.

Mergers & Acquisitions

In 2012 Western Digital bought Hitachi's disk drive business, HGST, for around $4.3 billion in cash and stock. The deal boosts Western Digital's share of the global market to nearly 50%, ahead of rival Seagate Technology which accounts for around 30% of global shipments. Strategically, the deal adds disk drives used with servers -- a large part of both Hitachi and Seagate's businesses -- and gives Western Digital a better foothold in solid-state drives used in tablets and other portable devices. The acquisition also provides Western Digital its first manufacturing foothold in China and the Philippines. With the stock portion of the sale, Hitachi gains a 10% stake in Western Digital and two spots on the board of directors.

Western Digital has long used acquisitions to add new product lines and extend its geographic reach. Over the past several years it bought the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya for about $233 million and entered the market for solid-state drives with the $65 million purchase of SiliconSystems. In a large 2007 acquisition, Western Digital bought disk component maker Komag for $1 billion, which gave it the ability to manufacture the media and substrates used in its drives.

Financial Analysis

Western Digital's sales have fluctuated in recent years as it has dealt with the worldwide economic downturn. However, its acquisition of HGST helped produce strong results for fiscal 2012 (ended June 30). The company's revenues grew 31% that year to $12.5 billion, with HGST contributing more than $3 billion of that. It also saw an improvement in hard drive average selling price from $45 in fiscal 2011 to $62 in fiscal 2012.

Although Western Digital saw increased R&D and SG&A expenses in 2012, the overall strength of revenues led to a 122% jump in net income (to $1.6 billion). – less",Corporate Litigator,$61K-$104K,Corporate law Commercial litigation Dispute resolution Contract law Legal strategy Negotiation,Dominican Republic,44200,Santo Domingo

The bank is primarily active in the UK, where it has some 1,700 branches, but also has significant retail and commercial operations in Europe, Africa (it owns more than half of South African bank Absa Group), the Middle East, and the US. Barclays Bank offers standard retail services such as deposit accounts and lending, including Woolwich-brand mortgages. The bank also provides commercial money transfer services, insurance products, the Barclaycard line of credit cards, and financial advisory services. Barclays Bank traces its roots to the late 17th century.

Barclays Bank has been building up its portfolio of global credit card accounts, especially as other financial groups sell off noncore units during the economic recovery. In 2010 the company acquired the Italian credit card accounts of Citigroup in a deal that included some 197,000 card accounts and approximately €234 million ($320 million) worth of assets. It previously bought Goldfish, the struggling UK credit card unit of Discover Financial Services, for some £46 million ($70 million). In 2011 Barclays acquired Egg UK's credit card portfolio, which added more than 1 million accounts; it has agreed to buy more Citibank card accounts.

The bank has also been offloading some of its own holdings as part of an overall corporate restructuring. In 2010 Barclays sold its US subprime loan servicing business, HomEq Servicing, to Ocwen Financial. It also announced plans to abandon retail banking in certain international markets and instead focus on wholesale and commercial banking. In 2011 it shuttered its Indonesian retail unit Bank Akita, which it had acquired only two years before. The company also sold its Russian retail and commercial operations to a group of investors, citing difficulties competing in the market. Barclays will instead focus on its investment banking activities in the region.

In 2010 Barclays acquired Standard Life Bank from Standard Life for £226 million ($369 million). The deal added Standard Life's savings and mortgage books to the Barclays fold. Also as part of the deal, Barclays and Standard Life entered into a partnership whereby Barclays markets pension products to its clients.

Despite challenges in the economy, especially in regards to Europe's debt problems, Barclays Bank's revenues grew 8% in 2011. Its Africa business performed relatively strongly, with credit impairments improving, as did Barclaycard, thanks to the portfolio acquisitions which delivered profits. That year the bank closed nearly 150 European branches (largely located in Spain), the costs of which contributed to a 5% decline in net income. – less",Training Coordinator,$65K-$102K,Training program coordination Training material development Learning management systems,USA,233904,"Washington, D.C."

With operations in more than 50 countries and 25,000 employees worldwide, Avery Dennison serves customers with insights and innovations that help make brands more inspiring and the world more intelligent.
Avery Dennison Corporation (NYSE: AVY) is a Fortune 500® company with sales of $6 billion from continuing operations in 2015. We are based in Glendale, California.

The Avery Dennison story begins in 1935, with just a few spare parts, one very bright idea and a $100 loan.

Ray Stanton (“Stan”) Avery, a struggling clerk in Los Angeles, invented a smarter way for stores to price their products, then went on to pioneer the labeling industry.

With a few simple materials—primarily used machine parts and a saber saw—Stan created and patented the first self-adhesive, die-cut labeling machine. His practical genius would ultimately yield eighteen patents and establish Avery Adhesives as the company that transformed how brands and businesses deliver information. In 1990, Avery International merged with Dennison Manufacturing to become Avery Dennison.

Today, we manufacture and distribute labeling and packaging materials in over 50 countries and employ more than 25,000 people. The flexibility and responsiveness afforded by our company's global footprint enables us to service our customers at key points throughout their supply chain.

In just over 80 years we have grown from one bright idea into a global corporation that continues to set new standards for quality and innovation in materials science.

Avery Dennison manufactures and distributes display graphics, labeling and packaging materials, retail graphic embellishments and RFID tags that companies around the world use to engage customers and efficiently manage their inventories. Our products are virtually everywhere you look, providing a crucial thread in the fabric of global commerce.

We sustain Stan Avery's spirit of curiosity through research, invention and development of new materials science products and processes. Our expertise in high-speed manufacturing, information display and management, logistics, branding, graphics and packaging enables us to impact a wide array of markets—from consumer packaged goods and apparel to transportation, architecture and healthcare.

We strive to make each customer's brand more inspiring and every process more intelligent.

Avery Dennison's extensive experience in our core businesses allows us to purchase, process, and deliver needed materials to key points in our customers' supply chains with rapid and globally consistent execution.

In the 21st century, the company will expand its footprint in emerging markets.

The pursuit of this vision has compelled us to align our businesses into a focused, customer-driven company that specializes in materials science. Our in-depth pool of expertise and global scale enable us to deliver insights, innovative products and intelligent solutions to customers all over the world. – less",Art Curator,$57K-$81K,Art history and knowledge Art curation and exhibition planning Collections management Art market trends Cultural awareness,Croatia,212922,Zagreb

Bruton Smith has raced Sonic Automotive to the front of the pack of US auto dealers behind larger rivals, such as AutoNation and Penske Automotive. Founded with five dealerships in 1997, Sonic today owns about 120 new- and used-vehicle dealerships and about 25 collision repair centers in major markets in 15 states, including Texas, the Carolinas, Tennessee and Georgia. The company sells some 30 brands of cars and light trucks and offers vehicle financing. Chairman Smith, who runs Sonic Automotive with his son Scott, is also the majority owner of Speedway Motorsports, which operates more than half a dozen NASCAR auto racetracks.

Financial Analysis

Overall, the company's revenues in 2011 accounted for some $7.8 billion versus around $3.6 billion in 2010. Net income came in at $77.6 million in 2011 compared to $95.9 million in 2010, a 15% decrease. In 2011 the impact of earthquakes and the tsunami that struck Japan disrupted the company's Japanese supply chain and vehicle production. Sonic's new vehicle revenues and gross margins were impacted, thus affecting net income. Sonics' new vehicle sales generated around $4.3 million (about 55% of revenues) in revenues in 2011; used vehicle sales accounted for some $2 million (around 25% of revenues), and the company's parts, service and collision segment accounted for around $1.2 million (some 15% of revenues) in revenues.

Operations

In 2011 the company sold approximately 12.7 million new vehicles compared to 11.6 million vehicles sold in 2010, a year-over-year increase of some 10%. The company sells new vehicles, including luxury (BMW, Lexus, Land Rover, and Volvo), mid-line import (Honda, Nissan, and Toyota), and domestic brands (Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors). Its luxury brands generated some 50% of revenues in 2011; while the company's mid-line and domestic brands accounted for about 35% and 15%, respectively.

Strategy

As part of the company's strategic plans, Sonic is primarily focused in growing its operations in metropolitan markets in the Southeast, Southwest, Midwest, and the West (California). The company's long-term growth strategy is to target luxury or mid-line import brands.

We are a leading, multi-category consumer goods company that provides tobacco and nicotine products to hundreds of millions of adult consumers worldwide.

We have been satisfying consumers, delivering shareholder value and creating valued employment for over a century. However, we are entering the most dynamic period of change our industry has ever encountered.

An unprecedented confluence of technology, societal change and public health awareness has created a unique opportunity: the opportunity to make a substantial leap forward in our long-held ambition to provide our consumers with potentially reduced-risk tobacco and nicotine choices.

Our acquisition of Reynolds American Inc. (RAI) in July 2017, which has transformed both the scale and geographic reach of our business and our portfolio of potentially reduced-risk products, now positions us perfectly to capitalise on this ambition.

We call this ambition Transforming Tobacco and we are fully committed to leading this transformation.


The way our people operate is embodied in our four Guiding Principles: Enterprising Spirit, Freedom Through Responsibility, Open Minded and Strength from Diversity. These principles underpin our culture and guide how we deliver our strategy.

The culture of the Group is about developing talent from within, stretching and supporting the high performing managers who will lead the delivery of our strategy. In 2017, over 92% of our senior appointments were drawn from people already within the business – moves that have helped deliver stronger and more diverse leadership teams.

Our employer brand – ‘Bring your Difference’ – has a strong presence across social media channels, including LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram. We are leading our industry in social media engagement and have moved ahead of several top FMCG companies.

It also offers a variety of investment products and services for individuals, businesses, and pension plans. Subsidiary Pacific Life & Annuity offers the same mix of life insurance and investment products and services for individuals and businesses in New York. Pacific Life was founded in 1868.

Operations

Pacific Life policyholders are members of parent Pacific Mutual Holding Company, which was created in 1997 following a conversion to the mutual holding company structure. Pacific LifeCorp is the intermediate stock holding company.

While life insurance is the company's bread and butter, it has brought in other operations for variety. Pacific Life's Aviation Capital Group subsidiary leases commercial jets to 90 airlines in more than 40 countries. It also manages aircraft assets for third parties such as commercial airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and financial institutions. Other subsidiaries include Pacific Asset Management, which provides third-party institutional asset management.

Sales & Marketing

Pacific Life's insurance policies are sold through independent distributors and through dealer/broker subsidiary Pacific Select Distributors.

Financial Analysis

The company's growth strategies helped Pacific Life achieve strong results in 2011, with revenues increasing 15% over 2010 to almost 6.7 billion, and net income increasing 29% to $679 million. Its operating income climbed a whopping 40% over 2010 to reach $823 million. The gains achieved were attributed to enhanced service offerings, expanded life insurance, annuity, and mutual fund product offerings, and the two acquisitions made that year.

Strategy

Being a mutual company, Pacific Life operates with a long-term focus to serve in the best interests of its policyholders and clients. in doing so, the company navigated the chilly economic waters of the 2008-2009 recession by steadily introducing new products and building up its capital reserves. By 2010 its net income had grown as risk-weary customers squirreled more of their savings and retirement monies into life insurance and mutual funds.

Mergers, Acquisitions & Divestitures

In 2008 the company added international reinsurance to its portfolio when it acquired the former London-based specialty reinsurance operations of Scottish Re and renamed the business as Pacific Life Re. It then added life retrocession (reinsurance of a reinsurer) to its line-up in 2011 by acquiring that business from Manulife and expanded its business to include the Toronto, Boston, Barbados, and Cologne markets.

Also in 2011 Pacific life bought JPMorgan Chase's pension risk advisory business to form Pacific Global Advisors. The unit offers risk management solutions and advisory services to pension plan sponsors.

It also engages in natural gas compressing, treating, processing, transporting, and selling. DCP Midstream LLC also transports and sells NGLs and distributes propane wholesale. The company operates natural gas gathering systems (5,300 miles of pipe) in eight states (including Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas), seven processing plants, four NGL pipelines, and nine propane storage terminals. Spectra Energy holds a 50% holding in DCP (ConocoPhillips holds the other 50%).

A consolidator in the fragmented natural gas gathering, NGLs, and wholesale propane industry segments, the company has been expanding its gas supply base and its propane wholesale network in recent years through strategic complementary acquisitions and joint ventures.

In 2012 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Texas-based Crossroads processing plant and gathering system from Penn Virginia Resource Partners for $63 million. The bolt-on acquisition allows the company to expand its market position in East Texas and provide services to drillers in the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley regions.

In 2011 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Seaway Products Pipeline Co. from ConocoPhillips. The pipeline, now called Southern Hills Pipeline and being converted to NGL service, is expected to be operational by mid-2013. It will provide NGL access from the Midcontinent to the Texas Gulf Coast.

The company agreed to form a joint venture with EQT Corporation to develop natural gas processing and related natural gas liquid (NGL) infrastructure in the Marcellus and Huron shale plays in the Appalachian basin. (However, the parties could not come to agreement and dropped the plan in early 2011). In 2010, the company acquired the Liberty gathering system and south Raywood processing plant from Ceritas Energy in southeast Texas. The pipeline system interconnects with DCP Midstream's Centana Intrastate Pipeline system.

Expanding in Michigan, in 2009 the company acquired gas gathering and treating assets for $45.1 million. In 2010 it acquired a 350-mile interstate natural gas liquids pipeline system in Colorado's Denver-Julesburg Basin from Buckeye Partners for $22 million.

In 2010 DCP Midstream Partners moved to extend its Northeast wholesale propane business into the MidAtlantic region, acquiring UGI's Atlantic Energy for $49 million. That year it also purchased of NGL storage company Marysville Hydrocarbon Holdings (in Michigan) for about $95 million.

Although DCP Midstream Partners' revenues suffered in 2009 as a result of the global recession and lower commodity prices, acquisitions and organic growth managed to offset lower natural gas volumes.  Acquisitions, increased demand, higher commodity and propane prices, and gains on derivatives help to lift the company's revenues and net income in 2010.

In terms of the company's origins, the D in DCP Midstream Partners (formerly Duke Energy Field Services) is for Duke Energy; the CP, ConocoPhillips. These two energy majors formed DCP Midstream Partners in 2005. Following the spinoff of Spectra Energy from Duke Energy in 2007, Spectra Energy assumed Duke Energy's 50% holding in DCP. – less",Sourcing Analyst,$57K-$87K,Sourcing strategies Supplier evaluation Market research Cost analysis Contract negotiation,Sudan,26531,Khartoum

It focuses on exploration and production assets in Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming, and western Canada. In 2011 Devon Energy reported proved reserves of 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent (58% natural gas) and more than 19,900 net acres of assets. It also drilled almost 2,500 gross wells. Devon Energy produces about 2.5 billion cu. ft. of natural gas a day (more than 3% of all the gas consumed in North America). The company is the largest producer and lease holder in the Barnett Shale (Texas) and is looking to replicate its success there to other unconventional plays.

Geographic Reach

Once active in major oil patches worldwide such as Azerbaijan, Brazil, and China, in the mid-2000s the company decided to focus on safer and increasingly productive unconventional onshore exploration opportunities (shales and oil sands) in North America. As a result, Devon Energy has sold all of its international assets.

Financial Analysis

Devon Energy posted a major improvement in revenues in 2010, thanks to higher commodity prices and an increase in production. In 2011, buoyed by record level reserves, high oil prices, and an increased demand for oil and gas products, the company posted a further 15% growth in revenues. Net income only rose by 3%, however, as higher operating, depreciation, deletion, and amortization costs and an increase in deferred income tax expense trimmed income growth.

Boosting its financial resources, in 2012 Devon Energy secured a commitment from Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration & Production for the Chinese company to invest $2.2 billion in exchange for one-third of Devon's interest in five new joint venture plays in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, Niobrara, Mississippian, Ohio Utica Shale, and the Michigan Basin.

That year it also closed a similar $1.4 billion joint venture deal with Sumitomo Corp. to develop 650,000 net acres in the Cline Shale and the Midland-Wolfcamp Shale in West Texas.

Strategy

In 2010 it sold most of its remaining international assets to BP for $7 billion. As part of this deal BP sold undeveloped oil sand leases in Canada to Devon Energy for $500 million and formed a joint venture with the company to exploit them. The company also sold its Panyu field, offshore China, to China National Offshore Oil for $515 million.

Consolidating its North American assets to just its onshore properties, In 2010 Devon Energy sold its stakes in the Cascade, Jack and St. Malo fields in the Gulf of Mexico (about 200 million barrels of estimated recoverable reserves) to AP Moller-Maersk's oil unit for $1.3 billion. It also sold its remaining Gulf of Mexico shelf assets to Apache for $1 billion. – less",Data Scientist,$59K-$123K,"Machine learning algorithms and libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch) Statistical analysis and modeling Data preprocessing and cleaning Big data technologies (e.g., Hadoop, Spark) Data visualization Strong programming skills (Python, R)",Vanuatu,175235,Port Vila

With operations in more than 50 countries and 25,000 employees worldwide, Avery Dennison serves customers with insights and innovations that help make brands more inspiring and the world more intelligent.
Avery Dennison Corporation (NYSE: AVY) is a Fortune 500® company with sales of $6 billion from continuing operations in 2015. We are based in Glendale, California.

The Avery Dennison story begins in 1935, with just a few spare parts, one very bright idea and a $100 loan.

Ray Stanton (“Stan”) Avery, a struggling clerk in Los Angeles, invented a smarter way for stores to price their products, then went on to pioneer the labeling industry.

With a few simple materials—primarily used machine parts and a saber saw—Stan created and patented the first self-adhesive, die-cut labeling machine. His practical genius would ultimately yield eighteen patents and establish Avery Adhesives as the company that transformed how brands and businesses deliver information. In 1990, Avery International merged with Dennison Manufacturing to become Avery Dennison.

Today, we manufacture and distribute labeling and packaging materials in over 50 countries and employ more than 25,000 people. The flexibility and responsiveness afforded by our company's global footprint enables us to service our customers at key points throughout their supply chain.

In just over 80 years we have grown from one bright idea into a global corporation that continues to set new standards for quality and innovation in materials science.

Avery Dennison manufactures and distributes display graphics, labeling and packaging materials, retail graphic embellishments and RFID tags that companies around the world use to engage customers and efficiently manage their inventories. Our products are virtually everywhere you look, providing a crucial thread in the fabric of global commerce.

We sustain Stan Avery's spirit of curiosity through research, invention and development of new materials science products and processes. Our expertise in high-speed manufacturing, information display and management, logistics, branding, graphics and packaging enables us to impact a wide array of markets—from consumer packaged goods and apparel to transportation, architecture and healthcare.

We strive to make each customer's brand more inspiring and every process more intelligent.

Avery Dennison's extensive experience in our core businesses allows us to purchase, process, and deliver needed materials to key points in our customers' supply chains with rapid and globally consistent execution.

In the 21st century, the company will expand its footprint in emerging markets.

The pursuit of this vision has compelled us to align our businesses into a focused, customer-driven company that specializes in materials science. Our in-depth pool of expertise and global scale enable us to deliver insights, innovative products and intelligent solutions to customers all over the world. – less",Environmental Planner,$64K-$116K,Environmental regulations Ecosystem analysis Environmental impact assessments Sustainability planning Project management,Ukraine,212338,Kyiv (also known as Kiev)

We have been satisfying consumers, delivering shareholder value and creating valued employment for over a century. However, we are entering the most dynamic period of change our industry has ever encountered.

An unprecedented confluence of technology, societal change and public health awareness has created a unique opportunity: the opportunity to make a substantial leap forward in our long-held ambition to provide our consumers with potentially reduced-risk tobacco and nicotine choices.

Our acquisition of Reynolds American Inc. (RAI) in July 2017, which has transformed both the scale and geographic reach of our business and our portfolio of potentially reduced-risk products, now positions us perfectly to capitalise on this ambition.

We call this ambition Transforming Tobacco and we are fully committed to leading this transformation.


The way our people operate is embodied in our four Guiding Principles: Enterprising Spirit, Freedom Through Responsibility, Open Minded and Strength from Diversity. These principles underpin our culture and guide how we deliver our strategy.

The culture of the Group is about developing talent from within, stretching and supporting the high performing managers who will lead the delivery of our strategy.

It focuses on exploration and production assets in Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming, and western Canada. In 2011 Devon Energy reported proved reserves of 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent (58% natural gas) and more than 19,900 net acres of assets. It also drilled almost 2,500 gross wells. Devon Energy produces about 2.5 billion cu. ft. of natural gas a day (more than 3% of all the gas consumed in North America). The company is the largest producer and lease holder in the Barnett Shale (Texas) and is looking to replicate its success there to other unconventional plays.

Geographic Reach

Once active in major oil patches worldwide such as Azerbaijan, Brazil, and China, in the mid-2000s the company decided to focus on safer and increasingly productive unconventional onshore exploration opportunities (shales and oil sands) in North America. As a result, Devon Energy has sold all of its international assets.

Financial Analysis

Devon Energy posted a major improvement in revenues in 2010, thanks to higher commodity prices and an increase in production. In 2011, buoyed by record level reserves, high oil prices, and an increased demand for oil and gas products, the company posted a further 15% growth in revenues. Net income only rose by 3%, however, as higher operating, depreciation, deletion, and amortization costs and an increase in deferred income tax expense trimmed income growth.

Boosting its financial resources, in 2012 Devon Energy secured a commitment from Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration & Production for the Chinese company to invest $2.2 billion in exchange for one-third of Devon's interest in five new joint venture plays in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, Niobrara, Mississippian, Ohio Utica Shale, and the Michigan Basin.

That year it also closed a similar $1.4 billion joint venture deal with Sumitomo Corp. to develop 650,000 net acres in the Cline Shale and the Midland-Wolfcamp Shale in West Texas.

Strategy

In 2010 it sold most of its remaining international assets to BP for $7 billion. As part of this deal BP sold undeveloped oil sand leases in Canada to Devon Energy for $500 million and formed a joint venture with the company to exploit them. The company also sold its Panyu field, offshore China, to China National Offshore Oil for $515 million.

Consolidating its North American assets to just its onshore properties, In 2010 Devon Energy sold its stakes in the Cascade, Jack and St. Malo fields in the Gulf of Mexico (about 200 million barrels of estimated recoverable reserves) to AP Moller-Maersk's oil unit for $1.3 billion.

The utility holding company distributes electricity to 3.4 million customers and natural gas to 1.9 million in eight states through four regulated utilities; Colorado and Minnesota account for most of its customers. Its utilities -- Northern States Power (NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin), Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service (in New Mexico and Texas) -- have the combined capacity of more than 17,150 MW of electricity. Xcel owns transmission and distribution lines, as well as natural gas assets. It is also the top wind power provider in the US, with wind farms in Colorado, Minnesota, and Texas.

Geographic Reach

The company serves customers in Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin.

 

Operations

Xcel operates power and gas utilities: Northern States Power, Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service. The holding company has more than 80 generating plants, more than 87,750 miles of transmission lines and about 191,840 miles of distribution lines. It also operates an interstate natural gas pipeline company and a joint venture to develop and lease natural gas pipelines, storage, and compression assets.

Financial Analysis

In 2011 Xcel reported a 3% jump in sales due to an increase in demand caused by a warmer-than-normal summer and a colder-than-normal winter. It was also assisted by a 3.7% increase in the electric segment due to cost recovery of the acquisition of the Rocky Mountain and Blue Spruce natural gas facilities by Public Service Company of Colorado and by natural gas retail rate increases in Minnesota.

Net income rose by 11% thanks to higher revenues and lower electric fuel and purchased power costs.

Higher rates and increased weather-related demand helped sales in 2010 to rise nearly 7%, going from $9.6 billion to about $10.3 billion. 

Strategy

Xcel is an energy company in transition, with long-term plans to move from coal-fired plants to natural gas, and on to alternative fuels such as wind, solar, and biomass to boost its green  power capacity (88,705 MWh by 2015).

In 2012 the company was seeking proposals for renewable resources other than wind or solar as part of its plan to diversify Southwestern Public Service Company  renewable energy portfolio.

As the largest US utility wind energy provider, Xcel controlled some 3,500 MW of wind energy in its portfolio in 2011 and plans to have 7,400 MW by 2020. In 2011 Xcel bought the 200 MW Limon Wind Energy Center, which will have 125 turbines in Lincoln and Elbert counties on Colorado's Front Range east of Denver. The company is also the US's fifth-largest utility solar energy provider and owns the fourth-largest transmission system. In addition, Xcel operates more than 25 hydroelectric power plants in Colorado, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.

The company believes its strategy of making environmentally sound investments is pivotal to its success. Among its 2010 projects were launching its 800-MW coal-fired unit in Colorado, known as Comanche 3, after installing advanced emission-reduction equipment. It also began construction of its CapX2020 project, a joint venture transmission expansion project with 10 other utilities, scheduled for completion by 2020. The project includes a 240-mile transmission line from Minnesota to North Dakota. The company has filed to extend the licensing plants of its two nuclear plants on Prairie Island in Minnesota for 20 years, which it expects to save customers more than $1 billion compared to alternative sources.

Xcel plans to construct one of the largest biomass generating plants in the Midwest. The facility, proposed for the Bay Front Generating Station in Ashland, Wisconsin, will generate power from burning wood waste in all three operating units by 2014. In 2011 Xcel had 73 MW of biomass generating power in Minnesota and Wisconsin.

Xcel is also working to develop so-called ""smart grid"" technology, which will provide customers with more reliability and control over their energy use. It has completed the nation's first fully integrated SmartGridCity in Boulder, Colorado.

In 2010 Xcel acquired two gas-fired power plants from Calpine Corporation for $739 million. The two Denver-area plants have a generating capacity of more than 900 MW and were already providing power to Public Service Company of Colorado under a contract agreement. The company is planning to acquire 775 MW of new wind-power capacity for its Colorado system over the next several years. – less",Manufacturing Engineer,$56K-$93K,Manufacturing processes knowledge CAD/CAM software proficiency Lean manufacturing principles Quality control and assurance Six Sigma certification,Isle of Man,214332,Douglas

A part of top US power firm Duke Energy, the regulated utility provides electricity services to about 2.4 million customers in North and South Carolina. Operating in a 24,000-square mile service territory, Duke Energy Carolinas has 101,400 miles of distribution cable. Its transmission system spans 13,100 miles. The utility has a net generating capacity of about 19,200 MW from interests in fossil-fueled, nuclear, and hydroelectric power plants. Duke Energy Carolinas also sells power to wholesale customers.

The utility's three nuclear plants account for more than a quarter of Duke Energy Carolinas' generating capacity.

Duke Energy Carolinas is investing $7 billion from 2010 to 2012 to expand its generating capacity and maintain its nuclear fuel and plants. By 2020 the company is looking to expand capacity by 5,400 MW, a strategy that brings new plants online while replacing older, less efficient ones.

The global recession produced weaker demand for power (especially from industrial customers) which lowered company revenues in 2009. However, the same downturn cut fuel expenses (including purchased power from third parties) resulting in only a slight dip in Duke Energy Carolinas' operating income.

In 2010 the company saw its revenues rise, primarily due to new retail electric base rates in North Carolina and South Carolina, and favorable weather conditions which spurred demand. Duke Energy Carolinas also posted higher net income, despite an increase in fuel costs and expenses related to an employee voluntary severance plan. – less",Industrial Designer,$56K-$94K,Industrial design principles CAD and 3D modeling Prototyping and testing,Netherlands,4171,Amsterdam

The bank is primarily active in the UK, where it has some 1,700 branches, but also has significant retail and commercial operations in Europe, Africa (it owns more than half of South African bank Absa Group), the Middle East, and the US. Barclays Bank offers standard retail services such as deposit accounts and lending, including Woolwich-brand mortgages. The bank also provides commercial money transfer services, insurance products, the Barclaycard line of credit cards, and financial advisory services. Barclays Bank traces its roots to the late 17th century.

Barclays Bank has been building up its portfolio of global credit card accounts, especially as other financial groups sell off noncore units during the economic recovery. In 2010 the company acquired the Italian credit card accounts of Citigroup in a deal that included some 197,000 card accounts and approximately €234 million ($320 million) worth of assets. It previously bought Goldfish, the struggling UK credit card unit of Discover Financial Services, for some £46 million ($70 million). In 2011 Barclays acquired Egg UK's credit card portfolio, which added more than 1 million accounts; it has agreed to buy more Citibank card accounts.

The bank has also been offloading some of its own holdings as part of an overall corporate restructuring. In 2010 Barclays sold its US subprime loan servicing business, HomEq Servicing, to Ocwen Financial. It also announced plans to abandon retail banking in certain international markets and instead focus on wholesale and commercial banking. In 2011 it shuttered its Indonesian retail unit Bank Akita, which it had acquired only two years before. The company also sold its Russian retail and commercial operations to a group of investors, citing difficulties competing in the market. Barclays will instead focus on its investment banking activities in the region.

In 2010 Barclays acquired Standard Life Bank from Standard Life for £226 million ($369 million). The deal added Standard Life's savings and mortgage books to the Barclays fold. Also as part of the deal, Barclays and Standard Life entered into a partnership whereby Barclays markets pension products to its clients.

Despite challenges in the economy, especially in regards to Europe's debt problems, Barclays Bank's revenues grew 8% in 2011. Its Africa business performed relatively strongly, with credit impairments improving, as did Barclaycard, thanks to the portfolio acquisitions which delivered profits. That year the bank closed nearly 150 European branches (largely located in Spain), the costs of which contributed to a 5% decline in net income. – less",Search Engine Marketer,$58K-$101K,Search engine marketing PPC advertising SEO strategy Data analysis Digital marketing skills,St. Martin (French part),234693,Marigot

Its Ameriprise Bank subsidiary offers deposits and loans. Ameriprise, which has about $630 billion of assets under management, distributes its products primarily through a network of more than 9,700 financial advisors.

The company has been sharpening its focus on its branded adviser network. It sold its Securities America independent broker-dealer subsidiary to Ladenburg Thalmann for some $150 million in 2011. Shortly before the sale of the troubled unit, Ameriprise agreed to pay $160 million to settle claims that Securities America brokers sold securities in fraudulent companies.

Ameriprise has been steadily boosting its assets under management and growing its client base (focusing on the affluent and mass affluent with at least $100,000 in investable assets). The company also is focused on geographic areas where those clients are congregated and has closed or consolidated offices in areas with less potential. While Columbia Management covers Ameriprise's main asset management market in the US, the company is increasing its global presence through its Threadneedle brand overseas. Ameriprise plans to grow its asset management operations in Europe, as well as in Australia, the Middle East, and Asia.

Ameriprise's strategies have paid off. Volatile financial market conditions, which negatively impacted all of the company's operations, led to a decline in revenue in 2008 and 2009. However, the company returned to success in 2010 and revenues grew by more than 20% that year. Poor economic conditions continued in 2011. However, Ameriprise's operating net revenues climbed that year by about 10%. The boost was due to strong growth in the company's fee-based advisory and asset management businesses.

The utility holding company distributes electricity to 3.4 million customers and natural gas to 1.9 million in eight states through four regulated utilities; Colorado and Minnesota account for most of its customers. Its utilities -- Northern States Power (NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin), Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service (in New Mexico and Texas) -- have the combined capacity of more than 17,150 MW of electricity. Xcel owns transmission and distribution lines, as well as natural gas assets. It is also the top wind power provider in the US, with wind farms in Colorado, Minnesota, and Texas.

Geographic Reach

The company serves customers in Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin.

 

Operations

Xcel operates power and gas utilities: Northern States Power, Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service. The holding company has more than 80 generating plants, more than 87,750 miles of transmission lines and about 191,840 miles of distribution lines. It also operates an interstate natural gas pipeline company and a joint venture to develop and lease natural gas pipelines, storage, and compression assets.

Financial Analysis

In 2011 Xcel reported a 3% jump in sales due to an increase in demand caused by a warmer-than-normal summer and a colder-than-normal winter. It was also assisted by a 3.7% increase in the electric segment due to cost recovery of the acquisition of the Rocky Mountain and Blue Spruce natural gas facilities by Public Service Company of Colorado and by natural gas retail rate increases in Minnesota.

Net income rose by 11% thanks to higher revenues and lower electric fuel and purchased power costs.

Higher rates and increased weather-related demand helped sales in 2010 to rise nearly 7%, going from $9.6 billion to about $10.3 billion. 

Strategy

Xcel is an energy company in transition, with long-term plans to move from coal-fired plants to natural gas, and on to alternative fuels such as wind, solar, and biomass to boost its green  power capacity (88,705 MWh by 2015).

In 2012 the company was seeking proposals for renewable resources other than wind or solar as part of its plan to diversify Southwestern Public Service Company  renewable energy portfolio.

As the largest US utility wind energy provider, Xcel controlled some 3,500 MW of wind energy in its portfolio in 2011 and plans to have 7,400 MW by 2020. In 2011 Xcel bought the 200 MW Limon Wind Energy Center, which will have 125 turbines in Lincoln and Elbert counties on Colorado's Front Range east of Denver. The company is also the US's fifth-largest utility solar energy provider and owns the fourth-largest transmission system. In addition, Xcel operates more than 25 hydroelectric power plants in Colorado, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.

The company believes its strategy of making environmentally sound investments is pivotal to its success. Among its 2010 projects were launching its 800-MW coal-fired unit in Colorado, known as Comanche 3, after installing advanced emission-reduction equipment. It also began construction of its CapX2020 project, a joint venture transmission expansion project with 10 other utilities, scheduled for completion by 2020. The project includes a 240-mile transmission line from Minnesota to North Dakota. The company has filed to extend the licensing plants of its two nuclear plants on Prairie Island in Minnesota for 20 years, which it expects to save customers more than $1 billion compared to alternative sources.

Xcel plans to construct one of the largest biomass generating plants in the Midwest. The facility, proposed for the Bay Front Generating Station in Ashland, Wisconsin, will generate power from burning wood waste in all three operating units by 2014. In 2011 Xcel had 73 MW of biomass generating power in Minnesota and Wisconsin.

Xcel is also working to develop so-called ""smart grid"" technology, which will provide customers with more reliability and control over their energy use. It has completed the nation's first fully integrated SmartGridCity in Boulder, Colorado.

In 2010 Xcel acquired two gas-fired power plants from Calpine Corporation for $739 million. The two Denver-area plants have a generating capacity of more than 900 MW and were already providing power to Public Service Company of Colorado under a contract agreement. The company is planning to acquire 775 MW of new wind-power capacity for its Colorado system over the next several years. – less",Digital Marketing Specialist,$59K-$97K,Digital marketing strategy Social media marketing Content creation SEO (Search Engine Optimization) PPC advertising Analytics and reporting,Comoros,213521,Moroni

Entergy New Orleans provides regulated electric and gas utility services to the population of New Orleans.

As a result of the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection a few weeks later; it emerged from bankruptcy in 2007.

After the onslaught of wind and rain caused by Katrina subsided, the city of New Orleans was left crippled and Entergy New Orleans' employees were scrambling to restore power to the city's pumping stations. The company was forced to create an interim headquarters in Clinton, Mississippi (a suburb of Jackson).

The mass evacuation and property damage caused by Hurricane Katrina severely reduced the population served by Entergy New Orleans. Before the big storm it had more than 190,000 electric customers and more than 144,000 gas customers.

The company reported a 10% drop in net revenue in 2011 due to lower electric rates and weak gas prices. However, net income jumped by $4.9 million thanks to lower operational and maintenance expenses, lower taxes, and lower interest expense.

To gain better financial returns, Entergy  plans to spin off its transmission businesses (including Entergy New Orleans') and merge them with a subsidiary of ITC Holdings.

In 2012, as part of a strategy to improve customer relations, Entergy New Orleans introduced a smartphone app to keep customers better informed about company and energy-related matters. – less",Web Designer,$62K-$123K,"Web design concepts Graphic design software (e.g., Adobe Creative Suite) HTML and CSS Responsive design User interface (UI) principles Visual communication Typography Color theory Creativity Attention to detail Collaboration",Tajikistan,107019,Dushanbe

Through its Foodservice division, PFG supplies more than 68,000 products to independent restaurants, hotels, other hospitality operators, and healthcare facilities through some 20 distribution facilities. The PFG Customized distribution unit serves chain restaurants such as Cracker Barrel and Ruby Tuesday. PFG subsidiary Vistar is a distributor of candy, snacks, and convenience foods for vending operators, retailers, and concessions. The company is owned by The Blackstone Group and Wellspring Capital Management, which took the business private in 2008.

Operations

With the $1.3 billion buyout in 2008 PFG was merged with Colorado-based Vistar (which was already controlled by Blackstone) to create a giant in the foodservice distribution industry with tentacles reaching into several markets. The combined business continues to operate under the PFG name, although each unit maintains its own headquarters. Across the company's foodservice, Vistar, and customized distribution businesses PFG collectively delivers more than 98,000 national- and proprietary-branded food and food-related products to more than 128,000 customers. As part of its operations, PFG maintains about 70 distribution centers and more than a dozen Merchant's Mart locations in the US.

Strategy

For PFG's broadline Performance Foodservice division, the focus has been on building the range of products it distributes to existing customers while improving margins. The division's more than 41,000 customers, located in about 40 countries, include franchisees of such chains as Burger King, Popeyes (owned by AFC Enterprises), and Subway. It also serves contract foodservice operators, such as Compass Group North America.

Mergers and Acquisitions

The company moved to expand its broadline division in mid-2012 by acquiring Carolina-based rival Institution Food House from Alex Lee. It also entered into an agreement in late 2012 to buy independent broadline foodservice distributor Fox River Foods, which serves seven states primarily in the Upper Midwestern region. The deals followed PFG's purchase in 2010 of Ledyard Company, which serves central and northern California. To add breadth to its product offering at its New England and Ohio offices, PFG in 2010 bought out the assets of VME Distributors.

With operations in more than 50 countries and 25,000 employees worldwide, Avery Dennison serves customers with insights and innovations that help make brands more inspiring and the world more intelligent.
Avery Dennison Corporation (NYSE: AVY) is a Fortune 500® company with sales of $6 billion from continuing operations in 2015. We are based in Glendale, California.

The Avery Dennison story begins in 1935, with just a few spare parts, one very bright idea and a $100 loan.

Ray Stanton (“Stan”) Avery, a struggling clerk in Los Angeles, invented a smarter way for stores to price their products, then went on to pioneer the labeling industry.

With a few simple materials—primarily used machine parts and a saber saw—Stan created and patented the first self-adhesive, die-cut labeling machine. His practical genius would ultimately yield eighteen patents and establish Avery Adhesives as the company that transformed how brands and businesses deliver information. In 1990, Avery International merged with Dennison Manufacturing to become Avery Dennison.

Today, we manufacture and distribute labeling and packaging materials in over 50 countries and employ more than 25,000 people. The flexibility and responsiveness afforded by our company's global footprint enables us to service our customers at key points throughout their supply chain.

In just over 80 years we have grown from one bright idea into a global corporation that continues to set new standards for quality and innovation in materials science.

Avery Dennison manufactures and distributes display graphics, labeling and packaging materials, retail graphic embellishments and RFID tags that companies around the world use to engage customers and efficiently manage their inventories. Our products are virtually everywhere you look, providing a crucial thread in the fabric of global commerce.

We sustain Stan Avery's spirit of curiosity through research, invention and development of new materials science products and processes. Our expertise in high-speed manufacturing, information display and management, logistics, branding, graphics and packaging enables us to impact a wide array of markets—from consumer packaged goods and apparel to transportation, architecture and healthcare.

We strive to make each customer's brand more inspiring and every process more intelligent.

Avery Dennison's extensive experience in our core businesses allows us to purchase, process, and deliver needed materials to key points in our customers' supply chains with rapid and globally consistent execution.

In the 21st century, the company will expand its footprint in emerging markets.

The pursuit of this vision has compelled us to align our businesses into a focused, customer-driven company that specializes in materials science. Our in-depth pool of expertise and global scale enable us to deliver insights, innovative products and intelligent solutions to customers all over the world. – less",Market Research Analyst,$64K-$106K,"Market research methodologies Data collection and analysis Consumer behavior analysis Competitor analysis Survey design and analysis Statistical analysis software (e.g., SPSS, SAS) Data visualization Trend analysis Report writing Communication skills Attention to detail",Romania,212028,Bucharest

Entergy New Orleans provides regulated electric and gas utility services to the population of New Orleans.

As a result of the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection a few weeks later; it emerged from bankruptcy in 2007.

After the onslaught of wind and rain caused by Katrina subsided, the city of New Orleans was left crippled and Entergy New Orleans' employees were scrambling to restore power to the city's pumping stations. The company was forced to create an interim headquarters in Clinton, Mississippi (a suburb of Jackson).

The mass evacuation and property damage caused by Hurricane Katrina severely reduced the population served by Entergy New Orleans. Before the big storm it had more than 190,000 electric customers and more than 144,000 gas customers.

The company reported a 10% drop in net revenue in 2011 due to lower electric rates and weak gas prices. However, net income jumped by $4.9 million thanks to lower operational and maintenance expenses, lower taxes, and lower interest expense.

To gain better financial returns, Entergy  plans to spin off its transmission businesses (including Entergy New Orleans') and merge them with a subsidiary of ITC Holdings.

In 2012, as part of a strategy to improve customer relations, Entergy New Orleans introduced a smartphone app to keep customers better informed about company and energy-related matters. – less",Executive Assistant,$62K-$122K,"Calendar management Travel coordination Meeting scheduling Correspondence and communication Office organization Confidentiality Time management Problem-solving Attention to detail Communication skills Technology proficiency (e.g., MS Office)",Mongolia,107124,Ulaanbaatar

Bruton Smith has raced Sonic Automotive to the front of the pack of US auto dealers behind larger rivals, such as AutoNation and Penske Automotive. Founded with five dealerships in 1997, Sonic today owns about 120 new- and used-vehicle dealerships and about 25 collision repair centers in major markets in 15 states, including Texas, the Carolinas, Tennessee and Georgia. The company sells some 30 brands of cars and light trucks and offers vehicle financing. Chairman Smith, who runs Sonic Automotive with his son Scott, is also the majority owner of Speedway Motorsports, which operates more than half a dozen NASCAR auto racetracks.

Financial Analysis

Overall, the company's revenues in 2011 accounted for some $7.8 billion versus around $3.6 billion in 2010. Net income came in at $77.6 million in 2011 compared to $95.9 million in 2010, a 15% decrease. In 2011 the impact of earthquakes and the tsunami that struck Japan disrupted the company's Japanese supply chain and vehicle production. Sonic's new vehicle revenues and gross margins were impacted, thus affecting net income. Sonics' new vehicle sales generated around $4.3 million (about 55% of revenues) in revenues in 2011; used vehicle sales accounted for some $2 million (around 25% of revenues), and the company's parts, service and collision segment accounted for around $1.2 million (some 15% of revenues) in revenues.

Operations

In 2011 the company sold approximately 12.7 million new vehicles compared to 11.6 million vehicles sold in 2010, a year-over-year increase of some 10%. The company sells new vehicles, including luxury (BMW, Lexus, Land Rover, and Volvo), mid-line import (Honda, Nissan, and Toyota), and domestic brands (Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors). Its luxury brands generated some 50% of revenues in 2011; while the company's mid-line and domestic brands accounted for about 35% and 15%, respectively.

Strategy

As part of the company's strategic plans, Sonic is primarily focused in growing its operations in metropolitan markets in the Southeast, Southwest, Midwest, and the West (California). The company's long-term growth strategy is to target luxury or mid-line import brands.

Ownership

The Smiths control the company through their ownership of about 75% of Sonic Automotive's voting stock. – less",Quality Control Engineer,$60K-$103K,"Quality control processes Quality assurance standards (e.g., ISO) Statistical analysis Inspection techniques Documenting quality issues Root cause analysis Communication with production teams Problem-solving Attention to detail Technical knowledge",Eswatini,62249,Mbabane

CenterPoint Energy's regulated utilities distribute natural gas to 3.3 million customers in six US states and electricity to more than 2 million customers on the Texas Gulf Coast. The company's main stomping ground is Texas, where it has regulated power distribution operations through subsidiary CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric. CenterPoint Energy operates more than 48,230 miles of power distribution lines, 8,000 miles of interstate gas pipeline, and 3,800 miles of gas gathering pipeline. It also provides natural gas field services. 

Operations

The company's natural gas distribution subsidiaries serve customers in Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas. (Texas represented 47% of all natural gas distribution customers in 2010). CenterPoint Energy also markets natural gas and related services to 12,200 commercial, industrial, and wholesale customers located primarily in the eastern US. It also provides HVAC and other energy-related services through its gas division.

Financial Analysis

CenterPoint Energy's sales dropped dramatically in 2009 as the global recession prompted a slump in commodity prices which hurt the performance of its different energy segments. A reviving economy in 2010 led to a stronger demand for power and gas (coupled with rate increases and weather-related spikes in consumption) resulting in a overall jump in revenues and net income that year.

Strategy

CenterPoint Energy's strategy is focused on enhancing and expanding existing core operations, while acquiring complementary and synergistic businesses. In 2011 the company acquired Denver-based natural gas marketing firm Asgard Energy, which supplies gas to agricultural, commercial, industrial, and residential customers in five states (Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, and West Virginia). The acquisition fit into CenterPoint's strategy to expand into the Rockies and diversify into residential choice markets.

In 2012, to add to its midstream assets, CenterPoint Energy Field Services (CEFS), an indirect subsidiary of the company, acquired gathering and processing assets from Prism Gas Systems, a subsidiary of Martin Midstream Partners for $275 million. The assets include Prism's 50% stake in Texas-based Waskom Gas Processing Co.

With the merger of Albertsons LLC and Safeway, Inc. in 2015, Albertsons Companies is now one of the largest food and drug retailers in the United States. The company operates more than 2,300 stores across 35 states and the District of Columbia under 19 well-known banners including Albertsons, Safeway, Vons, Jewel-Osco, Shaw's, Acme, Tom Thumb, Randalls, United Supermarkets, Pavilions, Star Market, Haggen and Carrs.

Albertsons Companies is dedicated to helping people across the country live better lives. In 2015 alone, with the help of our generous customers, Albertsons Companies and the Albertsons Companies Foundation gave more than $270 million in food and financial support to the more than 2,300 communities we serve, improving the lives of millions of people in the areas of hunger relief, education, cancer research and treatment, programs for people with disabilities, and veterans outreach.

All of our stores were founded around the philosophy of offering customers the products they wanted to buy at a fair price, with lots of tender, loving care.

We are a leading, multi-category consumer goods company that provides tobacco and nicotine products to hundreds of millions of adult consumers worldwide.

For decades, we have built our business on successfully meeting the preferences of adult smokers with world-famous cigarette brands, superior blends and market-leading innovations.

We have been satisfying consumers, delivering shareholder value and creating valued employment for over a century. However, we are entering the most dynamic period of change our industry has ever encountered.

An unprecedented confluence of technology, societal change and public health awareness has created a unique opportunity: the opportunity to make a substantial leap forward in our long-held ambition to provide our consumers with potentially reduced-risk tobacco and nicotine choices.

Our acquisition of Reynolds American Inc. (RAI) in July 2017, which has transformed both the scale and geographic reach of our business and our portfolio of potentially reduced-risk products, now positions us perfectly to capitalise on this ambition.

We call this ambition Transforming Tobacco and we are fully committed to leading this transformation.


The way our people operate is embodied in our four Guiding Principles: Enterprising Spirit, Freedom Through Responsibility, Open Minded and Strength from Diversity. These principles underpin our culture and guide how we deliver our strategy.

The culture of the Group is about developing talent from within, stretching and supporting the high performing managers who will lead the delivery of our strategy. In 2017, over 92% of our senior appointments were drawn from people already within the business – moves that have helped deliver stronger and more diverse leadership teams.

Our employer brand – ‘Bring your Difference’ – has a strong presence across social media channels, including LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram. We are leading our industry in social media engagement and have moved ahead of several top FMCG companies.

Providing a safe place to work, protecting our employees’ wellbeing and listening to their views are also fundamental.

The bank is primarily active in the UK, where it has some 1,700 branches, but also has significant retail and commercial operations in Europe, Africa (it owns more than half of South African bank Absa Group), the Middle East, and the US. Barclays Bank offers standard retail services such as deposit accounts and lending, including Woolwich-brand mortgages. The bank also provides commercial money transfer services, insurance products, the Barclaycard line of credit cards, and financial advisory services. Barclays Bank traces its roots to the late 17th century.

Barclays Bank has been building up its portfolio of global credit card accounts, especially as other financial groups sell off noncore units during the economic recovery. In 2010 the company acquired the Italian credit card accounts of Citigroup in a deal that included some 197,000 card accounts and approximately €234 million ($320 million) worth of assets. It previously bought Goldfish, the struggling UK credit card unit of Discover Financial Services, for some £46 million ($70 million). In 2011 Barclays acquired Egg UK's credit card portfolio, which added more than 1 million accounts; it has agreed to buy more Citibank card accounts.

The bank has also been offloading some of its own holdings as part of an overall corporate restructuring. In 2010 Barclays sold its US subprime loan servicing business, HomEq Servicing, to Ocwen Financial. It also announced plans to abandon retail banking in certain international markets and instead focus on wholesale and commercial banking. In 2011 it shuttered its Indonesian retail unit Bank Akita, which it had acquired only two years before. The company also sold its Russian retail and commercial operations to a group of investors, citing difficulties competing in the market. Barclays will instead focus on its investment banking activities in the region.

In 2010 Barclays acquired Standard Life Bank from Standard Life for £226 million ($369 million). The deal added Standard Life's savings and mortgage books to the Barclays fold. Also as part of the deal, Barclays and Standard Life entered into a partnership whereby Barclays markets pension products to its clients.

Despite challenges in the economy, especially in regards to Europe's debt problems, Barclays Bank's revenues grew 8% in 2011. Its Africa business performed relatively strongly, with credit impairments improving, as did Barclaycard, thanks to the portfolio acquisitions which delivered profits. That year the bank closed nearly 150 European branches (largely located in Spain), the costs of which contributed to a 5% decline in net income. – less",Database Developer,$56K-$126K,"Database design and development SQL and database querying Data modeling Programming languages (e.g., Java, Python) Data security and privacy regulations knowledge",Romania,234535,Bucharest

The utility holding company distributes electricity to 3.4 million customers and natural gas to 1.9 million in eight states through four regulated utilities; Colorado and Minnesota account for most of its customers. Its utilities -- Northern States Power (NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin), Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service (in New Mexico and Texas) -- have the combined capacity of more than 17,150 MW of electricity. Xcel owns transmission and distribution lines, as well as natural gas assets. It is also the top wind power provider in the US, with wind farms in Colorado, Minnesota, and Texas.

Geographic Reach

The company serves customers in Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin.

 

Operations

Xcel operates power and gas utilities: Northern States Power, Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service. The holding company has more than 80 generating plants, more than 87,750 miles of transmission lines and about 191,840 miles of distribution lines. It also operates an interstate natural gas pipeline company and a joint venture to develop and lease natural gas pipelines, storage, and compression assets.

Financial Analysis

In 2011 Xcel reported a 3% jump in sales due to an increase in demand caused by a warmer-than-normal summer and a colder-than-normal winter. It was also assisted by a 3.7% increase in the electric segment due to cost recovery of the acquisition of the Rocky Mountain and Blue Spruce natural gas facilities by Public Service Company of Colorado and by natural gas retail rate increases in Minnesota.

Net income rose by 11% thanks to higher revenues and lower electric fuel and purchased power costs.

Higher rates and increased weather-related demand helped sales in 2010 to rise nearly 7%, going from $9.6 billion to about $10.3 billion. 

Strategy

Xcel is an energy company in transition, with long-term plans to move from coal-fired plants to natural gas, and on to alternative fuels such as wind, solar, and biomass to boost its green  power capacity (88,705 MWh by 2015).

In 2012 the company was seeking proposals for renewable resources other than wind or solar as part of its plan to diversify Southwestern Public Service Company  renewable energy portfolio.

As the largest US utility wind energy provider, Xcel controlled some 3,500 MW of wind energy in its portfolio in 2011 and plans to have 7,400 MW by 2020. In 2011 Xcel bought the 200 MW Limon Wind Energy Center, which will have 125 turbines in Lincoln and Elbert counties on Colorado's Front Range east of Denver. The company is also the US's fifth-largest utility solar energy provider and owns the fourth-largest transmission system. In addition, Xcel operates more than 25 hydroelectric power plants in Colorado, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.

The company believes its strategy of making environmentally sound investments is pivotal to its success. Among its 2010 projects were launching its 800-MW coal-fired unit in Colorado, known as Comanche 3, after installing advanced emission-reduction equipment. It also began construction of its CapX2020 project, a joint venture transmission expansion project with 10 other utilities, scheduled for completion by 2020. The project includes a 240-mile transmission line from Minnesota to North Dakota. The company has filed to extend the licensing plants of its two nuclear plants on Prairie Island in Minnesota for 20 years, which it expects to save customers more than $1 billion compared to alternative sources.

Xcel plans to construct one of the largest biomass generating plants in the Midwest. The facility, proposed for the Bay Front Generating Station in Ashland, Wisconsin, will generate power from burning wood waste in all three operating units by 2014. In 2011 Xcel had 73 MW of biomass generating power in Minnesota and Wisconsin.

Xcel is also working to develop so-called ""smart grid"" technology, which will provide customers with more reliability and control over their energy use. It has completed the nation's first fully integrated SmartGridCity in Boulder, Colorado.

In 2010 Xcel acquired two gas-fired power plants from Calpine Corporation for $739 million. The two Denver-area plants have a generating capacity of more than 900 MW and were already providing power to Public Service Company of Colorado under a contract agreement. The company is planning to acquire 775 MW of new wind-power capacity for its Colorado system over the next several years. – less",UI/UX Front-End Developer,$62K-$98K,UI/UX design Frontend web development Wireframing and prototyping User research Accessibility standards Responsive design Collaboration skills,Netherlands,213286,Amsterdam

The company’s applications and technologies are an integral part of products used in every major market and industry.
With operations in more than 50 countries and 25,000 employees worldwide, Avery Dennison serves customers with insights and innovations that help make brands more inspiring and the world more intelligent.
Avery Dennison Corporation (NYSE: AVY) is a Fortune 500® company with sales of $6 billion from continuing operations in 2015. We are based in Glendale, California.

The Avery Dennison story begins in 1935, with just a few spare parts, one very bright idea and a $100 loan.

Ray Stanton (“Stan”) Avery, a struggling clerk in Los Angeles, invented a smarter way for stores to price their products, then went on to pioneer the labeling industry.

With a few simple materials—primarily used machine parts and a saber saw—Stan created and patented the first self-adhesive, die-cut labeling machine. His practical genius would ultimately yield eighteen patents and establish Avery Adhesives as the company that transformed how brands and businesses deliver information. In 1990, Avery International merged with Dennison Manufacturing to become Avery Dennison.

Today, we manufacture and distribute labeling and packaging materials in over 50 countries and employ more than 25,000 people. The flexibility and responsiveness afforded by our company's global footprint enables us to service our customers at key points throughout their supply chain.

In just over 80 years we have grown from one bright idea into a global corporation that continues to set new standards for quality and innovation in materials science.

Avery Dennison manufactures and distributes display graphics, labeling and packaging materials, retail graphic embellishments and RFID tags that companies around the world use to engage customers and efficiently manage their inventories. Our products are virtually everywhere you look, providing a crucial thread in the fabric of global commerce.

We sustain Stan Avery's spirit of curiosity through research, invention and development of new materials science products and processes. Our expertise in high-speed manufacturing, information display and management, logistics, branding, graphics and packaging enables us to impact a wide array of markets—from consumer packaged goods and apparel to transportation, architecture and healthcare.

We strive to make each customer's brand more inspiring and every process more intelligent.

Avery Dennison's extensive experience in our core businesses allows us to purchase, process, and deliver needed materials to key points in our customers' supply chains with rapid and globally consistent execution.

In the 21st century, the company will expand its footprint in emerging markets.

The pursuit of this vision has compelled us to align our businesses into a focused, customer-driven company that specializes in materials science. Our in-depth pool of expertise and global scale enable us to deliver insights, innovative products and intelligent solutions to customers all over the world. – less",Retirement Planner,$64K-$97K,Retirement planning Social security Investment products Tax planning Estate planning,"Micronesia, Fed.

Founded with five dealerships in 1997, Sonic today owns about 120 new- and used-vehicle dealerships and about 25 collision repair centers in major markets in 15 states, including Texas, the Carolinas, Tennessee and Georgia. The company sells some 30 brands of cars and light trucks and offers vehicle financing. Chairman Smith, who runs Sonic Automotive with his son Scott, is also the majority owner of Speedway Motorsports, which operates more than half a dozen NASCAR auto racetracks.

Financial Analysis

Overall, the company's revenues in 2011 accounted for some $7.8 billion versus around $3.6 billion in 2010. Net income came in at $77.6 million in 2011 compared to $95.9 million in 2010, a 15% decrease. In 2011 the impact of earthquakes and the tsunami that struck Japan disrupted the company's Japanese supply chain and vehicle production. Sonic's new vehicle revenues and gross margins were impacted, thus affecting net income. Sonics' new vehicle sales generated around $4.3 million (about 55% of revenues) in revenues in 2011; used vehicle sales accounted for some $2 million (around 25% of revenues), and the company's parts, service and collision segment accounted for around $1.2 million (some 15% of revenues) in revenues.

Operations

In 2011 the company sold approximately 12.7 million new vehicles compared to 11.6 million vehicles sold in 2010, a year-over-year increase of some 10%. The company sells new vehicles, including luxury (BMW, Lexus, Land Rover, and Volvo), mid-line import (Honda, Nissan, and Toyota), and domestic brands (Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors). Its luxury brands generated some 50% of revenues in 2011; while the company's mid-line and domestic brands accounted for about 35% and 15%, respectively.

Strategy

As part of the company's strategic plans, Sonic is primarily focused in growing its operations in metropolitan markets in the Southeast, Southwest, Midwest, and the West (California). The company's long-term growth strategy is to target luxury or mid-line import brands.

It also engages in natural gas compressing, treating, processing, transporting, and selling. DCP Midstream LLC also transports and sells NGLs and distributes propane wholesale. The company operates natural gas gathering systems (5,300 miles of pipe) in eight states (including Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas), seven processing plants, four NGL pipelines, and nine propane storage terminals. Spectra Energy holds a 50% holding in DCP (ConocoPhillips holds the other 50%).

A consolidator in the fragmented natural gas gathering, NGLs, and wholesale propane industry segments, the company has been expanding its gas supply base and its propane wholesale network in recent years through strategic complementary acquisitions and joint ventures.

In 2012 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Texas-based Crossroads processing plant and gathering system from Penn Virginia Resource Partners for $63 million. The bolt-on acquisition allows the company to expand its market position in East Texas and provide services to drillers in the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley regions.

In 2011 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Seaway Products Pipeline Co. from ConocoPhillips. The pipeline, now called Southern Hills Pipeline and being converted to NGL service, is expected to be operational by mid-2013. It will provide NGL access from the Midcontinent to the Texas Gulf Coast.

The company agreed to form a joint venture with EQT Corporation to develop natural gas processing and related natural gas liquid (NGL) infrastructure in the Marcellus and Huron shale plays in the Appalachian basin. (However, the parties could not come to agreement and dropped the plan in early 2011). In 2010, the company acquired the Liberty gathering system and south Raywood processing plant from Ceritas Energy in southeast Texas. The pipeline system interconnects with DCP Midstream's Centana Intrastate Pipeline system.

Expanding in Michigan, in 2009 the company acquired gas gathering and treating assets for $45.1 million. In 2010 it acquired a 350-mile interstate natural gas liquids pipeline system in Colorado's Denver-Julesburg Basin from Buckeye Partners for $22 million.

In 2010 DCP Midstream Partners moved to extend its Northeast wholesale propane business into the MidAtlantic region, acquiring UGI's Atlantic Energy for $49 million. That year it also purchased of NGL storage company Marysville Hydrocarbon Holdings (in Michigan) for about $95 million.

Although DCP Midstream Partners' revenues suffered in 2009 as a result of the global recession and lower commodity prices, acquisitions and organic growth managed to offset lower natural gas volumes.  Acquisitions, increased demand, higher commodity and propane prices, and gains on derivatives help to lift the company's revenues and net income in 2010.

In terms of the company's origins, the D in DCP Midstream Partners (formerly Duke Energy Field Services) is for Duke Energy; the CP, ConocoPhillips. These two energy majors formed DCP Midstream Partners in 2005. Following the spinoff of Spectra Energy from Duke Energy in 2007, Spectra Energy assumed Duke Energy's 50% holding in DCP. – less",Inside Sales Representative,$61K-$93K,"Sales prospecting and lead generation Sales presentation and communication CRM software (e.g., Salesforce) Sales negotiation and closing techniques Product knowledge Relationship building",Benin,25493,Porto-Novo

The regulated utility, a subsidiary of Entergy, distributes electricity to 161,000 residential, commercial, and industrial customers and natural gas to more than 100,000 customers in Orleans Parish, Louisiana; it also owns two generating stations that give it more than 930 MW of generating capacity. 

Entergy New Orleans provides regulated electric and gas utility services to the population of New Orleans.

As a result of the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection a few weeks later; it emerged from bankruptcy in 2007.

After the onslaught of wind and rain caused by Katrina subsided, the city of New Orleans was left crippled and Entergy New Orleans' employees were scrambling to restore power to the city's pumping stations. The company was forced to create an interim headquarters in Clinton, Mississippi (a suburb of Jackson).

The mass evacuation and property damage caused by Hurricane Katrina severely reduced the population served by Entergy New Orleans. Before the big storm it had more than 190,000 electric customers and more than 144,000 gas customers.

The company reported a 10% drop in net revenue in 2011 due to lower electric rates and weak gas prices. However, net income jumped by $4.9 million thanks to lower operational and maintenance expenses, lower taxes, and lower interest expense.

To gain better financial returns, Entergy  plans to spin off its transmission businesses (including Entergy New Orleans') and merge them with a subsidiary of ITC Holdings.

In 2012, as part of a strategy to improve customer relations, Entergy New Orleans introduced a smartphone app to keep customers better informed about company and energy-related matters. – less",Content SEO Strategist,$63K-$118K,Content strategy SEO content optimization Content marketing Keyword mapping Analytics,Curacao,106581,Willemstad

It focuses on exploration and production assets in Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming, and western Canada. In 2011 Devon Energy reported proved reserves of 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent (58% natural gas) and more than 19,900 net acres of assets. It also drilled almost 2,500 gross wells. Devon Energy produces about 2.5 billion cu. ft. of natural gas a day (more than 3% of all the gas consumed in North America). The company is the largest producer and lease holder in the Barnett Shale (Texas) and is looking to replicate its success there to other unconventional plays.

Geographic Reach

Once active in major oil patches worldwide such as Azerbaijan, Brazil, and China, in the mid-2000s the company decided to focus on safer and increasingly productive unconventional onshore exploration opportunities (shales and oil sands) in North America. As a result, Devon Energy has sold all of its international assets.

Financial Analysis

Devon Energy posted a major improvement in revenues in 2010, thanks to higher commodity prices and an increase in production. In 2011, buoyed by record level reserves, high oil prices, and an increased demand for oil and gas products, the company posted a further 15% growth in revenues. Net income only rose by 3%, however, as higher operating, depreciation, deletion, and amortization costs and an increase in deferred income tax expense trimmed income growth.

Boosting its financial resources, in 2012 Devon Energy secured a commitment from Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration & Production for the Chinese company to invest $2.2 billion in exchange for one-third of Devon's interest in five new joint venture plays in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, Niobrara, Mississippian, Ohio Utica Shale, and the Michigan Basin.

That year it also closed a similar $1.4 billion joint venture deal with Sumitomo Corp. to develop 650,000 net acres in the Cline Shale and the Midland-Wolfcamp Shale in West Texas.

Strategy

In 2010 it sold most of its remaining international assets to BP for $7 billion. As part of this deal BP sold undeveloped oil sand leases in Canada to Devon Energy for $500 million and formed a joint venture with the company to exploit them. The company also sold its Panyu field, offshore China, to China National Offshore Oil for $515 million.

Consolidating its North American assets to just its onshore properties, In 2010 Devon Energy sold its stakes in the Cascade, Jack and St. Malo fields in the Gulf of Mexico (about 200 million barrels of estimated recoverable reserves) to AP Moller-Maersk's oil unit for $1.3 billion. It also sold its remaining Gulf of Mexico shelf assets to Apache for $1 billion. – less",Personal Assistant,$63K-$99K,Organizational and time management skills Calendar and appointment management Communication and correspondence Travel coordination Discretion and confidentiality,Peru,175236,Lima

Its Ameriprise Bank subsidiary offers deposits and loans. Ameriprise, which has about $630 billion of assets under management, distributes its products primarily through a network of more than 9,700 financial advisors.

The company has been sharpening its focus on its branded adviser network. It sold its Securities America independent broker-dealer subsidiary to Ladenburg Thalmann for some $150 million in 2011. Shortly before the sale of the troubled unit, Ameriprise agreed to pay $160 million to settle claims that Securities America brokers sold securities in fraudulent companies.

Ameriprise has been steadily boosting its assets under management and growing its client base (focusing on the affluent and mass affluent with at least $100,000 in investable assets). The company also is focused on geographic areas where those clients are congregated and has closed or consolidated offices in areas with less potential. While Columbia Management covers Ameriprise's main asset management market in the US, the company is increasing its global presence through its Threadneedle brand overseas. Ameriprise plans to grow its asset management operations in Europe, as well as in Australia, the Middle East, and Asia.

Ameriprise's strategies have paid off. Volatile financial market conditions, which negatively impacted all of the company's operations, led to a decline in revenue in 2008 and 2009. However, the company returned to success in 2010 and revenues grew by more than 20% that year. Poor economic conditions continued in 2011. However, Ameriprise's operating net revenues climbed that year by about 10%. The boost was due to strong growth in the company's fee-based advisory and asset management businesses.

The PFG Customized distribution unit serves chain restaurants such as Cracker Barrel and Ruby Tuesday. PFG subsidiary Vistar is a distributor of candy, snacks, and convenience foods for vending operators, retailers, and concessions. The company is owned by The Blackstone Group and Wellspring Capital Management, which took the business private in 2008.

Operations

With the $1.3 billion buyout in 2008 PFG was merged with Colorado-based Vistar (which was already controlled by Blackstone) to create a giant in the foodservice distribution industry with tentacles reaching into several markets. The combined business continues to operate under the PFG name, although each unit maintains its own headquarters. Across the company's foodservice, Vistar, and customized distribution businesses PFG collectively delivers more than 98,000 national- and proprietary-branded food and food-related products to more than 128,000 customers. As part of its operations, PFG maintains about 70 distribution centers and more than a dozen Merchant's Mart locations in the US.

Strategy

For PFG's broadline Performance Foodservice division, the focus has been on building the range of products it distributes to existing customers while improving margins. The division's more than 41,000 customers, located in about 40 countries, include franchisees of such chains as Burger King, Popeyes (owned by AFC Enterprises), and Subway. It also serves contract foodservice operators, such as Compass Group North America.

Mergers and Acquisitions

The company moved to expand its broadline division in mid-2012 by acquiring Carolina-based rival Institution Food House from Alex Lee. It also entered into an agreement in late 2012 to buy independent broadline foodservice distributor Fox River Foods, which serves seven states primarily in the Upper Midwestern region. The deals followed PFG's purchase in 2010 of Ledyard Company, which serves central and northern California. To add breadth to its product offering at its New England and Ohio offices, PFG in 2010 bought out the assets of VME Distributors. The wholesale supplier catered to mobile caterers, office coffee services, schools, prisons, and vending operators that do business in New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. – less",Child Welfare Worker,$60K-$83K,Child welfare policies and regulations Child protective services Child development Crisis intervention Case management Cultural competence Interviewing and assessment skills Court procedures Documentation Empathy Communication skills,Brazil,295720,Brasilia

Western Digital,"{'Work Happiness Score': '69', 'Achievement': '79', 'Appreciation': '74', 'Flexibility': '74', 'Learning': '73', 'Purpose': '71', 'Trust': '69', 'Compensation': '69', 'Support': '69', 'Inclusion': '68', 'Energy': '67', 'Belonging': '66', 'Management': '65'}",3.8,"When it comes to data storage, Western Digital has drive. The company is one of the largest independent makers of hard-disk drives, which record, store, and recall volumes of data. Drives for PCs account for most of Western Digital's sales, although the company also makes devices used in servers, cloud computing data centers, and home entertainment products such as set-top boxes and video game consoles. The company sells to manufacturers and through retailers and distributors. More than 60% of its sales are to OEMs such as  Hewlett-Packard, which is Western Digital's largest customer. The company gets more than half of its sales from the Asia/Pacific region.

Operations

Western Digital is structured around two subsidiaries: WD Technologies and Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST). Each subsidiary maintains its own brand and product lines, with separate sales, marketing, operations, and product development teams. The company is looking to offer improved customer experiences for competing and complementary brands, while finding efficiencies in shared services.

Geographic Reach

The company is seeing strong growth in Asia (which represents more than 55% of sales) and the US (nearly 20%), with slower growth in the EMEA region (another nearly 20%). Western Digital has manufacturing facilities in the US and across Asia and sales offices worldwide.

Strategy

Western Digital is one of a handful of manufacturers that dominate the hard-disk drive market -- a sector characterized by harsh competition, short product life cycles, and aggressive price cuts. In order to reduce its dependence on drives for PCs, the company has branched into branded consumer media devices, including DVR expanders, portable media drives, and media players that let users play data from external drives on TV. Its WD TV Live Plus media player streams movies (including those offered by Netflix) and Internet video to a digital TV. It is also investing in products for the mobile computing and cloud computing markets.

Another promising market for Western Digital is nearline hard drives, which are more cost effective than traditional hard drives by providing more capacity while requiring lower power. Nearline hard drives are used for stimulated applications, such as video surveillance and medical imaging, and IT infrastructure applications, including scientific computing and Web search engines.

Mergers & Acquisitions

In 2012 Western Digital bought Hitachi's disk drive business, HGST, for around $4.3 billion in cash and stock. The deal boosts Western Digital's share of the global market to nearly 50%, ahead of rival Seagate Technology which accounts for around 30% of global shipments. Strategically, the deal adds disk drives used with servers -- a large part of both Hitachi and Seagate's businesses -- and gives Western Digital a better foothold in solid-state drives used in tablets and other portable devices. The acquisition also provides Western Digital its first manufacturing foothold in China and the Philippines. With the stock portion of the sale, Hitachi gains a 10% stake in Western Digital and two spots on the board of directors.

Western Digital has long used acquisitions to add new product lines and extend its geographic reach. Over the past several years it bought the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya for about $233 million and entered the market for solid-state drives with the $65 million purchase of SiliconSystems. In a large 2007 acquisition, Western Digital bought disk component maker Komag for $1 billion, which gave it the ability to manufacture the media and substrates used in its drives.

Financial Analysis

Western Digital's sales have fluctuated in recent years as it has dealt with the worldwide economic downturn. However, its acquisition of HGST helped produce strong results for fiscal 2012 (ended June 30). The company's revenues grew 31% that year to $12.5 billion, with HGST contributing more than $3 billion of that. It also saw an improvement in hard drive average selling price from $45 in fiscal 2011 to $62 in fiscal 2012.

Although Western Digital saw increased R&D and SG&A expenses in 2012, the overall strength of revenues led to a 122% jump in net income (to $1.6 billion). – less",Construction Project Manager,$62K-$119K,Construction management Budgeting Contract negotiation Safety regulations,Uzbekistan,44515,Tashkent

Through Ameriprise Financial, Columbia Management, RiverSource, and other affiliates and brands, the company provides access to insurance, mutual funds, savings plans, personal trust services, retail brokerage, and other financial products and services. Its Ameriprise Bank subsidiary offers deposits and loans. Ameriprise, which has about $630 billion of assets under management, distributes its products primarily through a network of more than 9,700 financial advisors.

The company has been sharpening its focus on its branded adviser network. It sold its Securities America independent broker-dealer subsidiary to Ladenburg Thalmann for some $150 million in 2011. Shortly before the sale of the troubled unit, Ameriprise agreed to pay $160 million to settle claims that Securities America brokers sold securities in fraudulent companies.

Ameriprise has been steadily boosting its assets under management and growing its client base (focusing on the affluent and mass affluent with at least $100,000 in investable assets). The company also is focused on geographic areas where those clients are congregated and has closed or consolidated offices in areas with less potential. While Columbia Management covers Ameriprise's main asset management market in the US, the company is increasing its global presence through its Threadneedle brand overseas. Ameriprise plans to grow its asset management operations in Europe, as well as in Australia, the Middle East, and Asia.

Ameriprise's strategies have paid off. Volatile financial market conditions, which negatively impacted all of the company's operations, led to a decline in revenue in 2008 and 2009. However, the company returned to success in 2010 and revenues grew by more than 20% that year. Poor economic conditions continued in 2011. However, Ameriprise's operating net revenues climbed that year by about 10%. The boost was due to strong growth in the company's fee-based advisory and asset management businesses.

The bank is primarily active in the UK, where it has some 1,700 branches, but also has significant retail and commercial operations in Europe, Africa (it owns more than half of South African bank Absa Group), the Middle East, and the US. Barclays Bank offers standard retail services such as deposit accounts and lending, including Woolwich-brand mortgages. The bank also provides commercial money transfer services, insurance products, the Barclaycard line of credit cards, and financial advisory services. Barclays Bank traces its roots to the late 17th century.

Barclays Bank has been building up its portfolio of global credit card accounts, especially as other financial groups sell off noncore units during the economic recovery. In 2010 the company acquired the Italian credit card accounts of Citigroup in a deal that included some 197,000 card accounts and approximately €234 million ($320 million) worth of assets. It previously bought Goldfish, the struggling UK credit card unit of Discover Financial Services, for some £46 million ($70 million). In 2011 Barclays acquired Egg UK's credit card portfolio, which added more than 1 million accounts; it has agreed to buy more Citibank card accounts.

The bank has also been offloading some of its own holdings as part of an overall corporate restructuring. In 2010 Barclays sold its US subprime loan servicing business, HomEq Servicing, to Ocwen Financial. It also announced plans to abandon retail banking in certain international markets and instead focus on wholesale and commercial banking. In 2011 it shuttered its Indonesian retail unit Bank Akita, which it had acquired only two years before. The company also sold its Russian retail and commercial operations to a group of investors, citing difficulties competing in the market. Barclays will instead focus on its investment banking activities in the region.

In 2010 Barclays acquired Standard Life Bank from Standard Life for £226 million ($369 million). The deal added Standard Life's savings and mortgage books to the Barclays fold. Also as part of the deal, Barclays and Standard Life entered into a partnership whereby Barclays markets pension products to its clients.

Despite challenges in the economy, especially in regards to Europe's debt problems, Barclays Bank's revenues grew 8% in 2011. Its Africa business performed relatively strongly, with credit impairments improving, as did Barclaycard, thanks to the portfolio acquisitions which delivered profits. That year the bank closed nearly 150 European branches (largely located in Spain), the costs of which contributed to a 5% decline in net income. – less",Equine Veterinarian,$65K-$99K,Equine veterinary medicine Horse anatomy and physiology Lameness evaluation Equine surgery Dentistry for horses Emergency equine care Equine reproductive health Compassion and empathy Client communication Problem-solving Attention to detail,Benin,234120,Porto-Novo

Progressive people work hard to keep us at the top of our industry, and are rewarded for it—with competitive pay, great benefits, the possibility of bonuses based on company performance, work-life balance opportunities, on-site fitness and health centers, and other special perks.

And we know that cultivating a diverse, inclusive, and flexible work environment is critical to our achievements. That’s why we promote from within, work hard and get rewarded for it, and win the right way.

Our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) play a key part in leveraging our differences to support an inclusive culture and provide insight into our diverse customers.

Auto-Owners Insurance Group operates through subsidiaries including Auto-Owners Life Insurance, Home-Owners Insurance, and Property-Owners Insurance Company. Its Southern-Owners Insurance subsidiary offers property/casualty insurance in Florida. Auto-Owners Insurance also sells commercial auto, liability, and workers' compensation policies. Established in 1916, the company operates in 26 states nationwide and is represented by more than 6,000 independent agencies.

Geographic Reach

Auto-Owners operates 85 claims, underwriting, and marketing offices in its 26-state service territory. The company's largest markets are Florida and Michigan.

Operations

Auto-Owners' revenues come from insurance premiums, as well as investment income. The company's property/casualty business accounts for about 90% of revenues and 80% of profits, with the remainder coming from premiums and income from the life insurance segment.

Financial Analysis

Auto-Owners reported a 5% increase in net written premiums in 2011 to nearly $5.2 billion, primarily due to growth within the Auto-Owners Insurance, Auto-Owners Life, and Home-Owners Insurance divisions. Total revenues were some $5.7 billion, while net income was reported at $69 million.

Strategy

Auto-Owners is focused on growing its business by establishing strong relationships with independent agents and by diversifying its product offerings. The company has also expanded by adding sales and service facilities in new and existing markets. In 2011 Auto-Owners opened five new branch locations to handle claims in Ashville, North Carolina; Kennesaw, Georgia; Little Rock, Arkansas; Madison, Wisconsin; and Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

The holding company distributes electricity to 2.4 million customers and natural gas to 900,000 customers in Missouri and Illinois through utility subsidiaries. Ameren has a generating capacity of 16,000 MW (primarily coal-fired), most of which is controlled by utility Union Electric (which does business as Ameren Missouri) and nonregulated subsidiary AmerenEnergy Resources Generating Company. Ameren, which also supplies merchant generation power to third parties, operates a nuclear power facility, three hydroelectric plants, and several coal-fired plants and turbine combustion facilities. It also purchases power, including windpower.

Operations

In addition to operating power plants, Ameren procures natural gas for its affiliated companies, builds new power plants, and provides long-term energy supply contracts. It also markets and trades electricity to wholesale and retail customers and provides risk management and other energy-related services.

Financial Analysis

Ameren's overall revenues dipped in 2011. While increased rates helped to lift Ameren Missouri's revenues in 2011, Ameren Illinois' regulated segment and the merchant generation segment both reported a drop in revenues. In particular, low gas prices and a warm winter hurt gas revenues. However, lower purchased power and resale gas, coupled with a drop in goodwill, impairment, and other charges, helped to lift Ameren's net income for the year.

Favorable weather conditions (which increased energy demand) and rate increases help to lift the company's revenues in 2010. However, impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets in the merchant generation segment (due to the sustained decline in market prices for electricity) dragged down Ameren's operating income.

Strategy

In 2010 the company combined AmerenIP, AmerenCIPS, and AmerenCILCO into one entity, Ameren Illinois, in order to streamline operations and reduce confusion among customers. The three Illinois utilities have operated as a single business since 2004 and deliver energy to more than 1,100 communities. Ameren Illinois also operates some 21,400 miles of natural gas distribution and transmission lines.

To comply with federal requirements to separate ownership of power generation and transmission businesses, the operations of Ameren subsidiaries' transmission assets are under the control ofMidwest Independent Transmission System Operator, a regional transmission organization that coordinates power across 15 Midwestern states and one Canadian Province.  – less",Infrastructure Manager,$63K-$97K,"Network administration System administration Virtualization technologies (e.g., VMware, Hyper-V) Storage management IT security Disaster recovery planning Capacity planning Monitoring and troubleshooting Cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Azure) Vendor management",Kazakhstan,100687,Nur-Sultan

Hormel opened a meat packing business in Austin, Minnesota. In 1926, the company introduced the country's first canned ham, and in 1937, it brought us Spam. In 1986, Hormel Foods Corporation acquired Jenny-O Foods, which was the nation's largest privately-owned turkey processor and at the beginning of the millennium it absorbed other major brands such as Diamond Crystal, Century Foods International, Lloyd's Barbeque, and Valley Fresh. In recent years, Hormel Foods Corporation has acquired Skippy peanut butter, Muscle Milk, and Applegate Farms, LLC. Still a major processor of pork and turkey in the U.S., the company's thirty-four brands continue to rank at the top in their respective markets. Hormel Foods Corporation operates joint ventures in seven foreign countries and exports to more the 50 countries around the world.

In 2015, Hormel Foods Corporation was named by Selling Power as a ""Best Company to Sell For"" and by Simplicity as one of the ""Best Places to Work for Recent Grads.""

Employees are provided with a non-contributory pension plan, a profit-sharing trust plan, and a 401(k) with employer matching.

Associates of Hormel Foods Corporation overwhelmingly approve of their leadership, particularly the current CEO. Employees commend the company for its ""generous benefits package"" yet the consensus among many is that is a ""lack of commitment to work-life balance"" exists in some locations. Some workers with Hormel Foods Corporation believe that the company's size is a benefit as it ""provides a lot of opportunities for growth and development"" and that the company tends to ""promote from within and invest in their people."" – less",Network Security Analyst,$65K-$96K,Network security protocols Intrusion detection and prevention Security incident response Firewall administration Vulnerability assessment Security policies and procedures Log analysis Ethical hacking Problem-solving Communication skills Attention to detail,Samoa,201357,Apia

The company is one of the largest independent makers of hard-disk drives, which record, store, and recall volumes of data. Drives for PCs account for most of Western Digital's sales, although the company also makes devices used in servers, cloud computing data centers, and home entertainment products such as set-top boxes and video game consoles. The company sells to manufacturers and through retailers and distributors. More than 60% of its sales are to OEMs such as  Hewlett-Packard, which is Western Digital's largest customer. The company gets more than half of its sales from the Asia/Pacific region.

Operations

Western Digital is structured around two subsidiaries: WD Technologies and Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST). Each subsidiary maintains its own brand and product lines, with separate sales, marketing, operations, and product development teams. The company is looking to offer improved customer experiences for competing and complementary brands, while finding efficiencies in shared services.

Geographic Reach

The company is seeing strong growth in Asia (which represents more than 55% of sales) and the US (nearly 20%), with slower growth in the EMEA region (another nearly 20%). Western Digital has manufacturing facilities in the US and across Asia and sales offices worldwide.

Strategy

Western Digital is one of a handful of manufacturers that dominate the hard-disk drive market -- a sector characterized by harsh competition, short product life cycles, and aggressive price cuts. In order to reduce its dependence on drives for PCs, the company has branched into branded consumer media devices, including DVR expanders, portable media drives, and media players that let users play data from external drives on TV. Its WD TV Live Plus media player streams movies (including those offered by Netflix) and Internet video to a digital TV. It is also investing in products for the mobile computing and cloud computing markets.

Another promising market for Western Digital is nearline hard drives, which are more cost effective than traditional hard drives by providing more capacity while requiring lower power. Nearline hard drives are used for stimulated applications, such as video surveillance and medical imaging, and IT infrastructure applications, including scientific computing and Web search engines.

Mergers & Acquisitions

In 2012 Western Digital bought Hitachi's disk drive business, HGST, for around $4.3 billion in cash and stock. The deal boosts Western Digital's share of the global market to nearly 50%, ahead of rival Seagate Technology which accounts for around 30% of global shipments. Strategically, the deal adds disk drives used with servers -- a large part of both Hitachi and Seagate's businesses -- and gives Western Digital a better foothold in solid-state drives used in tablets and other portable devices. The acquisition also provides Western Digital its first manufacturing foothold in China and the Philippines. With the stock portion of the sale, Hitachi gains a 10% stake in Western Digital and two spots on the board of directors.

Western Digital has long used acquisitions to add new product lines and extend its geographic reach. Over the past several years it bought the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya for about $233 million and entered the market for solid-state drives with the $65 million purchase of SiliconSystems. In a large 2007 acquisition, Western Digital bought disk component maker Komag for $1 billion, which gave it the ability to manufacture the media and substrates used in its drives.

Financial Analysis

Western Digital's sales have fluctuated in recent years as it has dealt with the worldwide economic downturn. However, its acquisition of HGST helped produce strong results for fiscal 2012 (ended June 30). The company's revenues grew 31% that year to $12.5 billion, with HGST contributing more than $3 billion of that. It also saw an improvement in hard drive average selling price from $45 in fiscal 2011 to $62 in fiscal 2012.

Although Western Digital saw increased R&D and SG&A expenses in 2012, the overall strength of revenues led to a 122% jump in net income (to $1.6 billion). – less",Wedding Designer,$56K-$114K,Wedding design concepts Decor selection and arrangement Creative flair,Virgin Islands (U.S.),44615,Charlotte Amalie

The utility holding company distributes electricity to 3.4 million customers and natural gas to 1.9 million in eight states through four regulated utilities; Colorado and Minnesota account for most of its customers. Its utilities -- Northern States Power (NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin), Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service (in New Mexico and Texas) -- have the combined capacity of more than 17,150 MW of electricity. Xcel owns transmission and distribution lines, as well as natural gas assets. It is also the top wind power provider in the US, with wind farms in Colorado, Minnesota, and Texas.

Geographic Reach

The company serves customers in Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin.

 

Operations

Xcel operates power and gas utilities: Northern States Power, Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service. The holding company has more than 80 generating plants, more than 87,750 miles of transmission lines and about 191,840 miles of distribution lines. It also operates an interstate natural gas pipeline company and a joint venture to develop and lease natural gas pipelines, storage, and compression assets.

Financial Analysis

In 2011 Xcel reported a 3% jump in sales due to an increase in demand caused by a warmer-than-normal summer and a colder-than-normal winter. It was also assisted by a 3.7% increase in the electric segment due to cost recovery of the acquisition of the Rocky Mountain and Blue Spruce natural gas facilities by Public Service Company of Colorado and by natural gas retail rate increases in Minnesota.

Net income rose by 11% thanks to higher revenues and lower electric fuel and purchased power costs.

Higher rates and increased weather-related demand helped sales in 2010 to rise nearly 7%, going from $9.6 billion to about $10.3 billion. 

Strategy

Xcel is an energy company in transition, with long-term plans to move from coal-fired plants to natural gas, and on to alternative fuels such as wind, solar, and biomass to boost its green  power capacity (88,705 MWh by 2015).

In 2012 the company was seeking proposals for renewable resources other than wind or solar as part of its plan to diversify Southwestern Public Service Company  renewable energy portfolio.

As the largest US utility wind energy provider, Xcel controlled some 3,500 MW of wind energy in its portfolio in 2011 and plans to have 7,400 MW by 2020. In 2011 Xcel bought the 200 MW Limon Wind Energy Center, which will have 125 turbines in Lincoln and Elbert counties on Colorado's Front Range east of Denver. The company is also the US's fifth-largest utility solar energy provider and owns the fourth-largest transmission system. In addition, Xcel operates more than 25 hydroelectric power plants in Colorado, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.

The company believes its strategy of making environmentally sound investments is pivotal to its success. Among its 2010 projects were launching its 800-MW coal-fired unit in Colorado, known as Comanche 3, after installing advanced emission-reduction equipment. It also began construction of its CapX2020 project, a joint venture transmission expansion project with 10 other utilities, scheduled for completion by 2020. The project includes a 240-mile transmission line from Minnesota to North Dakota. The company has filed to extend the licensing plants of its two nuclear plants on Prairie Island in Minnesota for 20 years, which it expects to save customers more than $1 billion compared to alternative sources.

Xcel plans to construct one of the largest biomass generating plants in the Midwest. The facility, proposed for the Bay Front Generating Station in Ashland, Wisconsin, will generate power from burning wood waste in all three operating units by 2014. In 2011 Xcel had 73 MW of biomass generating power in Minnesota and Wisconsin.

Xcel is also working to develop so-called ""smart grid"" technology, which will provide customers with more reliability and control over their energy use. It has completed the nation's first fully integrated SmartGridCity in Boulder, Colorado.

In 2010 Xcel acquired two gas-fired power plants from Calpine Corporation for $739 million. The two Denver-area plants have a generating capacity of more than 900 MW and were already providing power to Public Service Company of Colorado under a contract agreement. The company is planning to acquire 775 MW of new wind-power capacity for its Colorado system over the next several years. – less",SEM Analyst,$56K-$130K,Search engine marketing (SEM) Google Ads Bing Ads Keyword analysis Ad performance analysis SEM strategy development Bid management,Central African Republic,214800,Bangui

A consolidator in the fragmented natural gas gathering, NGLs, and wholesale propane industry segments, the company has been expanding its gas supply base and its propane wholesale network in recent years through strategic complementary acquisitions and joint ventures.

In 2012 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Texas-based Crossroads processing plant and gathering system from Penn Virginia Resource Partners for $63 million. The bolt-on acquisition allows the company to expand its market position in East Texas and provide services to drillers in the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley regions.

In 2011 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Seaway Products Pipeline Co. from ConocoPhillips. The pipeline, now called Southern Hills Pipeline and being converted to NGL service, is expected to be operational by mid-2013. It will provide NGL access from the Midcontinent to the Texas Gulf Coast.

The company agreed to form a joint venture with EQT Corporation to develop natural gas processing and related natural gas liquid (NGL) infrastructure in the Marcellus and Huron shale plays in the Appalachian basin. (However, the parties could not come to agreement and dropped the plan in early 2011). In 2010, the company acquired the Liberty gathering system and south Raywood processing plant from Ceritas Energy in southeast Texas. The pipeline system interconnects with DCP Midstream's Centana Intrastate Pipeline system.

Expanding in Michigan, in 2009 the company acquired gas gathering and treating assets for $45.1 million. In 2010 it acquired a 350-mile interstate natural gas liquids pipeline system in Colorado's Denver-Julesburg Basin from Buckeye Partners for $22 million.

In 2010 DCP Midstream Partners moved to extend its Northeast wholesale propane business into the MidAtlantic region, acquiring UGI's Atlantic Energy for $49 million. That year it also purchased of NGL storage company Marysville Hydrocarbon Holdings (in Michigan) for about $95 million.

Although DCP Midstream Partners' revenues suffered in 2009 as a result of the global recession and lower commodity prices, acquisitions and organic growth managed to offset lower natural gas volumes.  Acquisitions, increased demand, higher commodity and propane prices, and gains on derivatives help to lift the company's revenues and net income in 2010.

In terms of the company's origins, the D in DCP Midstream Partners (formerly Duke Energy Field Services) is for Duke Energy; the CP, ConocoPhillips. These two energy majors formed DCP Midstream Partners in 2005. Following the spinoff of Spectra Energy from Duke Energy in 2007, Spectra Energy assumed Duke Energy's 50% holding in DCP. – less",User Experience Designer,$56K-$95K,"User-centered design principles UX/UI design tools (e.g., Sketch, Adobe XD) Wireframing and prototyping Usability testing and user research Information architecture and user flows",Aruba,26569,Oranjestad

The regulated utility, a subsidiary of Entergy, distributes electricity to 161,000 residential, commercial, and industrial customers and natural gas to more than 100,000 customers in Orleans Parish, Louisiana; it also owns two generating stations that give it more than 930 MW of generating capacity. 

Entergy New Orleans provides regulated electric and gas utility services to the population of New Orleans.

As a result of the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection a few weeks later; it emerged from bankruptcy in 2007.

After the onslaught of wind and rain caused by Katrina subsided, the city of New Orleans was left crippled and Entergy New Orleans' employees were scrambling to restore power to the city's pumping stations. The company was forced to create an interim headquarters in Clinton, Mississippi (a suburb of Jackson).

The mass evacuation and property damage caused by Hurricane Katrina severely reduced the population served by Entergy New Orleans. Before the big storm it had more than 190,000 electric customers and more than 144,000 gas customers.

The company reported a 10% drop in net revenue in 2011 due to lower electric rates and weak gas prices. However, net income jumped by $4.9 million thanks to lower operational and maintenance expenses, lower taxes, and lower interest expense.

To gain better financial returns, Entergy  plans to spin off its transmission businesses (including Entergy New Orleans') and merge them with a subsidiary of ITC Holdings.

In 2012, as part of a strategy to improve customer relations, Entergy New Orleans introduced a smartphone app to keep customers better informed about company and energy-related matters. – less",Machine Learning Engineer,$61K-$124K,Machine learning algorithms Python programming Data preprocessing Deep learning Model evaluation,Mauritius,106332,City of Port Louis

A part of top US power firm Duke Energy, the regulated utility provides electricity services to about 2.4 million customers in North and South Carolina. Operating in a 24,000-square mile service territory, Duke Energy Carolinas has 101,400 miles of distribution cable. Its transmission system spans 13,100 miles. The utility has a net generating capacity of about 19,200 MW from interests in fossil-fueled, nuclear, and hydroelectric power plants. Duke Energy Carolinas also sells power to wholesale customers.

The utility's three nuclear plants account for more than a quarter of Duke Energy Carolinas' generating capacity.

Duke Energy Carolinas is investing $7 billion from 2010 to 2012 to expand its generating capacity and maintain its nuclear fuel and plants. By 2020 the company is looking to expand capacity by 5,400 MW, a strategy that brings new plants online while replacing older, less efficient ones.

The global recession produced weaker demand for power (especially from industrial customers) which lowered company revenues in 2009. However, the same downturn cut fuel expenses (including purchased power from third parties) resulting in only a slight dip in Duke Energy Carolinas' operating income.

In 2010 the company saw its revenues rise, primarily due to new retail electric base rates in North Carolina and South Carolina, and favorable weather conditions which spurred demand. Duke Energy Carolinas also posted higher net income, despite an increase in fuel costs and expenses related to an employee voluntary severance plan. – less",Surgical Physician Assistant,$63K-$126K,Surgical procedures and techniques Operating room protocols Anesthesia management,Bahrain,5387,Manama

It focuses on exploration and production assets in Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming, and western Canada. In 2011 Devon Energy reported proved reserves of 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent (58% natural gas) and more than 19,900 net acres of assets. It also drilled almost 2,500 gross wells. Devon Energy produces about 2.5 billion cu. ft. of natural gas a day (more than 3% of all the gas consumed in North America). The company is the largest producer and lease holder in the Barnett Shale (Texas) and is looking to replicate its success there to other unconventional plays.

Geographic Reach

Once active in major oil patches worldwide such as Azerbaijan, Brazil, and China, in the mid-2000s the company decided to focus on safer and increasingly productive unconventional onshore exploration opportunities (shales and oil sands) in North America. As a result, Devon Energy has sold all of its international assets.

Financial Analysis

Devon Energy posted a major improvement in revenues in 2010, thanks to higher commodity prices and an increase in production. In 2011, buoyed by record level reserves, high oil prices, and an increased demand for oil and gas products, the company posted a further 15% growth in revenues. Net income only rose by 3%, however, as higher operating, depreciation, deletion, and amortization costs and an increase in deferred income tax expense trimmed income growth.

Boosting its financial resources, in 2012 Devon Energy secured a commitment from Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration & Production for the Chinese company to invest $2.2 billion in exchange for one-third of Devon's interest in five new joint venture plays in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, Niobrara, Mississippian, Ohio Utica Shale, and the Michigan Basin.

That year it also closed a similar $1.4 billion joint venture deal with Sumitomo Corp. to develop 650,000 net acres in the Cline Shale and the Midland-Wolfcamp Shale in West Texas.

Strategy

In 2010 it sold most of its remaining international assets to BP for $7 billion. As part of this deal BP sold undeveloped oil sand leases in Canada to Devon Energy for $500 million and formed a joint venture with the company to exploit them. The company also sold its Panyu field, offshore China, to China National Offshore Oil for $515 million.

Consolidating its North American assets to just its onshore properties, In 2010 Devon Energy sold its stakes in the Cascade, Jack and St. Malo fields in the Gulf of Mexico (about 200 million barrels of estimated recoverable reserves) to AP Moller-Maersk's oil unit for $1.3 billion. It also sold its remaining Gulf of Mexico shelf assets to Apache for $1 billion. – less",Live Chat Support Agent,$55K-$87K,Live chat support Online customer communication Problem resolution,Turkmenistan,176455,Ashgabat

This promotes and rewards the entrepreneurial spirit as well as team accomplishment.

The company sells some 30 brands of cars and light trucks and offers vehicle financing. Chairman Smith, who runs Sonic Automotive with his son Scott, is also the majority owner of Speedway Motorsports, which operates more than half a dozen NASCAR auto racetracks.

Financial Analysis

Overall, the company's revenues in 2011 accounted for some $7.8 billion versus around $3.6 billion in 2010. Net income came in at $77.6 million in 2011 compared to $95.9 million in 2010, a 15% decrease. In 2011 the impact of earthquakes and the tsunami that struck Japan disrupted the company's Japanese supply chain and vehicle production. Sonic's new vehicle revenues and gross margins were impacted, thus affecting net income. Sonics' new vehicle sales generated around $4.3 million (about 55% of revenues) in revenues in 2011; used vehicle sales accounted for some $2 million (around 25% of revenues), and the company's parts, service and collision segment accounted for around $1.2 million (some 15% of revenues) in revenues.

Operations

In 2011 the company sold approximately 12.7 million new vehicles compared to 11.6 million vehicles sold in 2010, a year-over-year increase of some 10%. The company sells new vehicles, including luxury (BMW, Lexus, Land Rover, and Volvo), mid-line import (Honda, Nissan, and Toyota), and domestic brands (Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors). Its luxury brands generated some 50% of revenues in 2011; while the company's mid-line and domestic brands accounted for about 35% and 15%, respectively.

Strategy

As part of the company's strategic plans, Sonic is primarily focused in growing its operations in metropolitan markets in the Southeast, Southwest, Midwest, and the West (California). The company's long-term growth strategy is to target luxury or mid-line import brands.

The bank is primarily active in the UK, where it has some 1,700 branches, but also has significant retail and commercial operations in Europe, Africa (it owns more than half of South African bank Absa Group), the Middle East, and the US. Barclays Bank offers standard retail services such as deposit accounts and lending, including Woolwich-brand mortgages. The bank also provides commercial money transfer services, insurance products, the Barclaycard line of credit cards, and financial advisory services. Barclays Bank traces its roots to the late 17th century.

Barclays Bank has been building up its portfolio of global credit card accounts, especially as other financial groups sell off noncore units during the economic recovery. In 2010 the company acquired the Italian credit card accounts of Citigroup in a deal that included some 197,000 card accounts and approximately €234 million ($320 million) worth of assets. It previously bought Goldfish, the struggling UK credit card unit of Discover Financial Services, for some £46 million ($70 million). In 2011 Barclays acquired Egg UK's credit card portfolio, which added more than 1 million accounts; it has agreed to buy more Citibank card accounts.

The bank has also been offloading some of its own holdings as part of an overall corporate restructuring. In 2010 Barclays sold its US subprime loan servicing business, HomEq Servicing, to Ocwen Financial. It also announced plans to abandon retail banking in certain international markets and instead focus on wholesale and commercial banking. In 2011 it shuttered its Indonesian retail unit Bank Akita, which it had acquired only two years before. The company also sold its Russian retail and commercial operations to a group of investors, citing difficulties competing in the market. Barclays will instead focus on its investment banking activities in the region.

In 2010 Barclays acquired Standard Life Bank from Standard Life for £226 million ($369 million). The deal added Standard Life's savings and mortgage books to the Barclays fold. Also as part of the deal, Barclays and Standard Life entered into a partnership whereby Barclays markets pension products to its clients.

Despite challenges in the economy, especially in regards to Europe's debt problems, Barclays Bank's revenues grew 8% in 2011. Its Africa business performed relatively strongly, with credit impairments improving, as did Barclaycard, thanks to the portfolio acquisitions which delivered profits. That year the bank closed nearly 150 European branches (largely located in Spain), the costs of which contributed to a 5% decline in net income. – less",Nurse Educator,$56K-$85K,Nursing education Curriculum development Clinical instruction Assessment and evaluation Educational technology Communication skills,Paraguay,233527,AsunciÃ³n
