It also engages in natural gas compressing, treating, processing, transporting, and selling. DCP Midstream LLC also transports and sells NGLs and distributes propane wholesale. The company operates natural gas gathering systems (5,300 miles of pipe) in eight states (including Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas), seven processing plants, four NGL pipelines, and nine propane storage terminals. Spectra Energy holds a 50% holding in DCP (ConocoPhillips holds the other 50%).

A consolidator in the fragmented natural gas gathering, NGLs, and wholesale propane industry segments, the company has been expanding its gas supply base and its propane wholesale network in recent years through strategic complementary acquisitions and joint ventures.

In 2012 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Texas-based Crossroads processing plant and gathering system from Penn Virginia Resource Partners for $63 million. The bolt-on acquisition allows the company to expand its market position in East Texas and provide services to drillers in the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley regions.

In 2011 DCP Midstream Partners acquired the Seaway Products Pipeline Co. from ConocoPhillips. The pipeline, now called Southern Hills Pipeline and being converted to NGL service, is expected to be operational by mid-2013. It will provide NGL access from the Midcontinent to the Texas Gulf Coast.

The company agreed to form a joint venture with EQT Corporation to develop natural gas processing and related natural gas liquid (NGL) infrastructure in the Marcellus and Huron shale plays in the Appalachian basin. (However, the parties could not come to agreement and dropped the plan in early 2011). In 2010, the company acquired the Liberty gathering system and south Raywood processing plant from Ceritas Energy in southeast Texas. The pipeline system interconnects with DCP Midstream's Centana Intrastate Pipeline system.

Expanding in Michigan, in 2009 the company acquired gas gathering and treating assets for $45.1 million. In 2010 it acquired a 350-mile interstate natural gas liquids pipeline system in Colorado's Denver-Julesburg Basin from Buckeye Partners for $22 million.

In 2010 DCP Midstream Partners moved to extend its Northeast wholesale propane business into the MidAtlantic region, acquiring UGI's Atlantic Energy for $49 million. That year it also purchased of NGL storage company Marysville Hydrocarbon Holdings (in Michigan) for about $95 million.

Although DCP Midstream Partners' revenues suffered in 2009 as a result of the global recession and lower commodity prices, acquisitions and organic growth managed to offset lower natural gas volumes.  Acquisitions, increased demand, higher commodity and propane prices, and gains on derivatives help to lift the company's revenues and net income in 2010.

In terms of the company's origins, the D in DCP Midstream Partners (formerly Duke Energy Field Services) is for Duke Energy; the CP, ConocoPhillips. These two energy majors formed DCP Midstream Partners in 2005. Following the spinoff of Spectra Energy from Duke Energy in 2007, Spectra Energy assumed Duke Energy's 50% holding in DCP. – less",Cloud Architect,$59K-$120K,"Cloud computing platforms (AWS, Azure, etc.) Cloud security Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes)",Suva

The company is one of the largest independent makers of hard-disk drives, which record, store, and recall volumes of data. Drives for PCs account for most of Western Digital's sales, although the company also makes devices used in servers, cloud computing data centers, and home entertainment products such as set-top boxes and video game consoles. The company sells to manufacturers and through retailers and distributors. More than 60% of its sales are to OEMs such as  Hewlett-Packard, which is Western Digital's largest customer. The company gets more than half of its sales from the Asia/Pacific region.

Operations

Western Digital is structured around two subsidiaries: WD Technologies and Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST). Each subsidiary maintains its own brand and product lines, with separate sales, marketing, operations, and product development teams. The company is looking to offer improved customer experiences for competing and complementary brands, while finding efficiencies in shared services.

Geographic Reach

The company is seeing strong growth in Asia (which represents more than 55% of sales) and the US (nearly 20%), with slower growth in the EMEA region (another nearly 20%). Western Digital has manufacturing facilities in the US and across Asia and sales offices worldwide.

Strategy

Western Digital is one of a handful of manufacturers that dominate the hard-disk drive market -- a sector characterized by harsh competition, short product life cycles, and aggressive price cuts. In order to reduce its dependence on drives for PCs, the company has branched into branded consumer media devices, including DVR expanders, portable media drives, and media players that let users play data from external drives on TV. Its WD TV Live Plus media player streams movies (including those offered by Netflix) and Internet video to a digital TV. It is also investing in products for the mobile computing and cloud computing markets.

Another promising market for Western Digital is nearline hard drives, which are more cost effective than traditional hard drives by providing more capacity while requiring lower power. Nearline hard drives are used for stimulated applications, such as video surveillance and medical imaging, and IT infrastructure applications, including scientific computing and Web search engines.

Mergers & Acquisitions

In 2012 Western Digital bought Hitachi's disk drive business, HGST, for around $4.3 billion in cash and stock. The deal boosts Western Digital's share of the global market to nearly 50%, ahead of rival Seagate Technology which accounts for around 30% of global shipments. Strategically, the deal adds disk drives used with servers -- a large part of both Hitachi and Seagate's businesses -- and gives Western Digital a better foothold in solid-state drives used in tablets and other portable devices. The acquisition also provides Western Digital its first manufacturing foothold in China and the Philippines. With the stock portion of the sale, Hitachi gains a 10% stake in Western Digital and two spots on the board of directors.

Western Digital has long used acquisitions to add new product lines and extend its geographic reach. Over the past several years it bought the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya for about $233 million and entered the market for solid-state drives with the $65 million purchase of SiliconSystems. In a large 2007 acquisition, Western Digital bought disk component maker Komag for $1 billion, which gave it the ability to manufacture the media and substrates used in its drives.

Financial Analysis

Western Digital's sales have fluctuated in recent years as it has dealt with the worldwide economic downturn. However, its acquisition of HGST helped produce strong results for fiscal 2012 (ended June 30). The company's revenues grew 31% that year to $12.5 billion, with HGST contributing more than $3 billion of that. It also saw an improvement in hard drive average selling price from $45 in fiscal 2011 to $62 in fiscal 2012.

Although Western Digital saw increased R&D and SG&A expenses in 2012, the overall strength of revenues led to a 122% jump in net income (to $1.6 billion). – less",Social Media Manager,$60K-$95K,"Social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) Content creation and scheduling Social media analytics and insights Community engagement Paid social advertising",San Juan

In a large 2007 acquisition, Western Digital bought disk component maker Komag for $1 billion, which gave it the ability to manufacture the media and substrates used in its drives.

Financial Analysis

Western Digital's sales have fluctuated in recent years as it has dealt with the worldwide economic downturn. However, its acquisition of HGST helped produce strong results for fiscal 2012 (ended June 30). The company's revenues grew 31% that year to $12.5 billion, with HGST contributing more than $3 billion of that. It also saw an improvement in hard drive average selling price from $45 in fiscal 2011 to $62 in fiscal 2012.

Although Western Digital saw increased R&D and SG&A expenses in 2012, the overall strength of revenues led to a 122% jump in net income (to $1.6 billion). – less",Process Engineer,$57K-$103K,Process optimization Manufacturing processes Lean Six Sigma methodologies Data analysis Statistical process control Quality management Root cause analysis Collaboration Problem-solving Attention to detail Technical knowledge,Oranjestad

The holding company distributes electricity to 2.4 million customers and natural gas to 900,000 customers in Missouri and Illinois through utility subsidiaries. Ameren has a generating capacity of 16,000 MW (primarily coal-fired), most of which is controlled by utility Union Electric (which does business as Ameren Missouri) and nonregulated subsidiary AmerenEnergy Resources Generating Company. Ameren, which also supplies merchant generation power to third parties, operates a nuclear power facility, three hydroelectric plants, and several coal-fired plants and turbine combustion facilities. It also purchases power, including windpower.

Operations

In addition to operating power plants, Ameren procures natural gas for its affiliated companies, builds new power plants, and provides long-term energy supply contracts. It also markets and trades electricity to wholesale and retail customers and provides risk management and other energy-related services.

Financial Analysis

Ameren's overall revenues dipped in 2011. While increased rates helped to lift Ameren Missouri's revenues in 2011, Ameren Illinois' regulated segment and the merchant generation segment both reported a drop in revenues. In particular, low gas prices and a warm winter hurt gas revenues. However, lower purchased power and resale gas, coupled with a drop in goodwill, impairment, and other charges, helped to lift Ameren's net income for the year.

Favorable weather conditions (which increased energy demand) and rate increases help to lift the company's revenues in 2010. However, impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets in the merchant generation segment (due to the sustained decline in market prices for electricity) dragged down Ameren's operating income.

Strategy

In 2010 the company combined AmerenIP, AmerenCIPS, and AmerenCILCO into one entity, Ameren Illinois, in order to streamline operations and reduce confusion among customers. The three Illinois utilities have operated as a single business since 2004 and deliver energy to more than 1,100 communities. Ameren Illinois also operates some 21,400 miles of natural gas distribution and transmission lines.

To comply with federal requirements to separate ownership of power generation and transmission businesses, the operations of Ameren subsidiaries' transmission assets are under the control ofMidwest Independent Transmission System Operator, a regional transmission organization that coordinates power across 15 Midwestern states and one Canadian Province.  – less",Desktop Support Technician,$56K-$82K,"Desktop hardware and software troubleshooting Operating system expertise (e.g., Windows, macOS) Remote desktop support Hardware and software upgrades Customer service skills",Libreville

The regulated utility, a subsidiary of Entergy, distributes electricity to 161,000 residential, commercial, and industrial customers and natural gas to more than 100,000 customers in Orleans Parish, Louisiana; it also owns two generating stations that give it more than 930 MW of generating capacity. 

Entergy New Orleans provides regulated electric and gas utility services to the population of New Orleans.

As a result of the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection a few weeks later; it emerged from bankruptcy in 2007.

After the onslaught of wind and rain caused by Katrina subsided, the city of New Orleans was left crippled and Entergy New Orleans' employees were scrambling to restore power to the city's pumping stations. The company was forced to create an interim headquarters in Clinton, Mississippi (a suburb of Jackson).

The mass evacuation and property damage caused by Hurricane Katrina severely reduced the population served by Entergy New Orleans. Before the big storm it had more than 190,000 electric customers and more than 144,000 gas customers.

The company reported a 10% drop in net revenue in 2011 due to lower electric rates and weak gas prices. However, net income jumped by $4.9 million thanks to lower operational and maintenance expenses, lower taxes, and lower interest expense.

To gain better financial returns, Entergy  plans to spin off its transmission businesses (including Entergy New Orleans') and merge them with a subsidiary of ITC Holdings.

In 2012, as part of a strategy to improve customer relations, Entergy New Orleans introduced a smartphone app to keep customers better informed about company and energy-related matters. – less",IT Support Specialist,$65K-$107K,Technical troubleshooting Hardware and software support Customer service Problem-solving Communication,Quito

We are a leading, multi-category consumer goods company that provides tobacco and nicotine products to hundreds of millions of adult consumers worldwide.

For decades, we have built our business on successfully meeting the preferences of adult smokers with world-famous cigarette brands, superior blends and market-leading innovations.

We have been satisfying consumers, delivering shareholder value and creating valued employment for over a century. However, we are entering the most dynamic period of change our industry has ever encountered.

An unprecedented confluence of technology, societal change and public health awareness has created a unique opportunity: the opportunity to make a substantial leap forward in our long-held ambition to provide our consumers with potentially reduced-risk tobacco and nicotine choices.

Our acquisition of Reynolds American Inc. (RAI) in July 2017, which has transformed both the scale and geographic reach of our business and our portfolio of potentially reduced-risk products, now positions us perfectly to capitalise on this ambition.

We call this ambition Transforming Tobacco and we are fully committed to leading this transformation.


The way our people operate is embodied in our four Guiding Principles: Enterprising Spirit, Freedom Through Responsibility, Open Minded and Strength from Diversity. These principles underpin our culture and guide how we deliver our strategy.

The culture of the Group is about developing talent from within, stretching and supporting the high performing managers who will lead the delivery of our strategy. In 2017, over 92% of our senior appointments were drawn from people already within the business – moves that have helped deliver stronger and more diverse leadership teams.

Our employer brand – ‘Bring your Difference’ – has a strong presence across social media channels, including LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram. We are leading our industry in social media engagement and have moved ahead of several top FMCG companies.

Providing a safe place to work, protecting our employees’ wellbeing and listening to their views are also fundamental.

CenterPoint Energy's regulated utilities distribute natural gas to 3.3 million customers in six US states and electricity to more than 2 million customers on the Texas Gulf Coast. The company's main stomping ground is Texas, where it has regulated power distribution operations through subsidiary CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric. CenterPoint Energy operates more than 48,230 miles of power distribution lines, 8,000 miles of interstate gas pipeline, and 3,800 miles of gas gathering pipeline. It also provides natural gas field services. 

Operations

The company's natural gas distribution subsidiaries serve customers in Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas. (Texas represented 47% of all natural gas distribution customers in 2010). CenterPoint Energy also markets natural gas and related services to 12,200 commercial, industrial, and wholesale customers located primarily in the eastern US. It also provides HVAC and other energy-related services through its gas division.

Financial Analysis

CenterPoint Energy's sales dropped dramatically in 2009 as the global recession prompted a slump in commodity prices which hurt the performance of its different energy segments. A reviving economy in 2010 led to a stronger demand for power and gas (coupled with rate increases and weather-related spikes in consumption) resulting in a overall jump in revenues and net income that year.

Strategy

CenterPoint Energy's strategy is focused on enhancing and expanding existing core operations, while acquiring complementary and synergistic businesses. In 2011 the company acquired Denver-based natural gas marketing firm Asgard Energy, which supplies gas to agricultural, commercial, industrial, and residential customers in five states (Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, and West Virginia). The acquisition fit into CenterPoint's strategy to expand into the Rockies and diversify into residential choice markets.

In 2012, to add to its midstream assets, CenterPoint Energy Field Services (CEFS), an indirect subsidiary of the company, acquired gathering and processing assets from Prism Gas Systems, a subsidiary of Martin Midstream Partners for $275 million. The assets include Prism's 50% stake in Texas-based Waskom Gas Processing Co. A CEFS subsidiary owns the other 50% stake in Waskom.  – less",Network Engineer,$57K-$99K,"Network infrastructure design Routing and switching Network protocols (e.g., TCP/IP) Cisco or Juniper certifications Troubleshooting and diagnostics Security protocols Wireless networking Network monitoring Collaboration Problem-solving Attention to detail",Tallinn
Community Health Systems,{},3.3,"Community Health Systems (CHS) isn't much of a city dweller. The hospital operator prefers small-town America, owning or leasing about 140 hospitals mostly in rural areas or small cities in about 30 states. Its hospitals (which house roughly 20,000 beds) typically act as the sole or primary acute health care provider in a service area and offer a variety of medical, surgical, and emergency services (though a handful are specialty centers). The hospitals generally have ancillary facilities including doctors' offices, surgery centers, and diagnostic imaging facilities, as well as home health and hospice agencies. CHS' Quorum Health Resources subsidiary provides management services to non-affiliated hospitals.

Sales & Marketing

CHS receives about 40% of its revenues from Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements for patient services. Another 50% comes from commercial insurance companies with which it has managed care contracts, and the rest is attributed to self-pay patients. 

Financial Analysis

As it has expanded its network of facilities over the years, CHS' revenues have likewise risen. The company reported a 5% increase in sales in 2011 to some $13.6 billion. It attributes its financial health to its targeted acquisitions strategy (focusing on urban markets) and its successful cost-control and facility integration efforts, as well as improved returns from rate, reimbursement, and procurement programs. Profits have also steadily risen over the firm's history; however, CHS experienced a 28% decrease in net income in 2011 as the company restructured some of its debt obligations and took goodwill impairment charges on some divested assets.

Strategy

You don't become one of the largest for-profit hospital operators in the nation without a pretty aggressive acquisition strategy, and CHS certainly has that. CHS' modus operandi is to target hospitals in non-urban locations poised for growth. Because such areas have fewer people, they generally have fewer hospitals, which means less competition (both for patients and for managed care contracts). CHS typically purchases a number of small community hospitals each year, though it also sometimes conducts larger acquisitions of hospital operating groups.

In addition to adding new hospitals and clinics, CHS looks to grow revenue and profitability at its existing facilities. Its strategy focuses on recruiting primary care doctors and specialists; expanding services; investing in technology and facility improvements; and controlling costs through, among other things, centralizing some business operations. For instance, CHS tries to trim supply costs through its membership in group purchasing organization HealthTrust, which negotiates price agreements with suppliers on behalf of its members. CHS also adds complex services to its line-up, including orthopedics, cardiovascular services, and urology, thereby making its facilities more attractive to potential physicians and patients.

The firm expects its earnings to increase in coming years thanks to an aging population. It also hopes to benefit from reform measures that aim to increase the number of insured patients in the US, which could cut down on self-pay patients and reduce the amount of bad debt its hospitals carry.

In addition, the company sometimes divests facilities it deems as not core to its strategy. For instance in 2011 it sold two Oklahoma facilities, SouthCrest Hospital and Claremore Regional Hospital, to Ardent Health Services' Hillcrest HealthCare System unit for an undisclosed price. It also sold a Texas hospital, Cleveland Regional Medical Center, that year to New Directions Health Systems.

Mergers & Acquisitions

While the company's efforts to acquire rival hospital operator Tenet backfired in 2011, CHS completed several smaller purchases that year, including the acquisition of the Mercy Health Partners Scranton operations in Pennsylvania from Catholic Health Partners. Several of the company's recent acquisitions have extended its small-community acquisition philosophy into the fringe or exurbs of attractive metropolitan markets, such as the 2012 purchase of MetroSouth Medical Center in the southwestern suburbs of Chicago. Also in 2012, CHS added community hospitals and other health centers in northeastern Pennsylvania (including Moses Taylor Hospital) and in southeastern Pennsylvania (including Memorial Hospital). – less",Logistics Analyst,$64K-$82K,Supply chain analysis Data analytics Inventory management Transportation planning Problem-solving,Castries

It attributes its financial health to its targeted acquisitions strategy (focusing on urban markets) and its successful cost-control and facility integration efforts, as well as improved returns from rate, reimbursement, and procurement programs. Profits have also steadily risen over the firm's history; however, CHS experienced a 28% decrease in net income in 2011 as the company restructured some of its debt obligations and took goodwill impairment charges on some divested assets.

Strategy

You don't become one of the largest for-profit hospital operators in the nation without a pretty aggressive acquisition strategy, and CHS certainly has that. CHS' modus operandi is to target hospitals in non-urban locations poised for growth. Because such areas have fewer people, they generally have fewer hospitals, which means less competition (both for patients and for managed care contracts). CHS typically purchases a number of small community hospitals each year, though it also sometimes conducts larger acquisitions of hospital operating groups.

In addition to adding new hospitals and clinics, CHS looks to grow revenue and profitability at its existing facilities. Its strategy focuses on recruiting primary care doctors and specialists; expanding services; investing in technology and facility improvements; and controlling costs through, among other things, centralizing some business operations. For instance, CHS tries to trim supply costs through its membership in group purchasing organization HealthTrust, which negotiates price agreements with suppliers on behalf of its members. CHS also adds complex services to its line-up, including orthopedics, cardiovascular services, and urology, thereby making its facilities more attractive to potential physicians and patients.

The firm expects its earnings to increase in coming years thanks to an aging population. It also hopes to benefit from reform measures that aim to increase the number of insured patients in the US, which could cut down on self-pay patients and reduce the amount of bad debt its hospitals carry.

In addition, the company sometimes divests facilities it deems as not core to its strategy. For instance in 2011 it sold two Oklahoma facilities, SouthCrest Hospital and Claremore Regional Hospital, to Ardent Health Services' Hillcrest HealthCare System unit for an undisclosed price. It also sold a Texas hospital, Cleveland Regional Medical Center, that year to New Directions Health Systems.

Mergers & Acquisitions

While the company's efforts to acquire rival hospital operator Tenet backfired in 2011, CHS completed several smaller purchases that year, including the acquisition of the Mercy Health Partners Scranton operations in Pennsylvania from Catholic Health Partners. Several of the company's recent acquisitions have extended its small-community acquisition philosophy into the fringe or exurbs of attractive metropolitan markets, such as the 2012 purchase of MetroSouth Medical Center in the southwestern suburbs of Chicago. Also in 2012, CHS added community hospitals and other health centers in northeastern Pennsylvania (including Moses Taylor Hospital) and in southeastern Pennsylvania (including Memorial Hospital). – less",IT Business Analyst,$63K-$125K,Business process analysis Requirement gathering Data analysis Communication skills,Ouagadougou

It focuses on exploration and production assets in Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming, and western Canada. In 2011 Devon Energy reported proved reserves of 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent (58% natural gas) and more than 19,900 net acres of assets. It also drilled almost 2,500 gross wells. Devon Energy produces about 2.5 billion cu. ft. of natural gas a day (more than 3% of all the gas consumed in North America). The company is the largest producer and lease holder in the Barnett Shale (Texas) and is looking to replicate its success there to other unconventional plays.

Geographic Reach

Once active in major oil patches worldwide such as Azerbaijan, Brazil, and China, in the mid-2000s the company decided to focus on safer and increasingly productive unconventional onshore exploration opportunities (shales and oil sands) in North America. As a result, Devon Energy has sold all of its international assets.

Financial Analysis

Devon Energy posted a major improvement in revenues in 2010, thanks to higher commodity prices and an increase in production. In 2011, buoyed by record level reserves, high oil prices, and an increased demand for oil and gas products, the company posted a further 15% growth in revenues. Net income only rose by 3%, however, as higher operating, depreciation, deletion, and amortization costs and an increase in deferred income tax expense trimmed income growth.

Boosting its financial resources, in 2012 Devon Energy secured a commitment from Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration & Production for the Chinese company to invest $2.2 billion in exchange for one-third of Devon's interest in five new joint venture plays in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, Niobrara, Mississippian, Ohio Utica Shale, and the Michigan Basin.

That year it also closed a similar $1.4 billion joint venture deal with Sumitomo Corp. to develop 650,000 net acres in the Cline Shale and the Midland-Wolfcamp Shale in West Texas.

Strategy

In 2010 it sold most of its remaining international assets to BP for $7 billion. As part of this deal BP sold undeveloped oil sand leases in Canada to Devon Energy for $500 million and formed a joint venture with the company to exploit them. The company also sold its Panyu field, offshore China, to China National Offshore Oil for $515 million.

Consolidating its North American assets to just its onshore properties, In 2010 Devon Energy sold its stakes in the Cascade, Jack and St. Malo fields in the Gulf of Mexico (about 200 million barrels of estimated recoverable reserves) to AP Moller-Maersk's oil unit for $1.3 billion.

The company offers financial planning, products, and services to individual and institutional investors. Through Ameriprise Financial, Columbia Management, RiverSource, and other affiliates and brands, the company provides access to insurance, mutual funds, savings plans, personal trust services, retail brokerage, and other financial products and services. Its Ameriprise Bank subsidiary offers deposits and loans. Ameriprise, which has about $630 billion of assets under management, distributes its products primarily through a network of more than 9,700 financial advisors.

The company has been sharpening its focus on its branded adviser network. It sold its Securities America independent broker-dealer subsidiary to Ladenburg Thalmann for some $150 million in 2011. Shortly before the sale of the troubled unit, Ameriprise agreed to pay $160 million to settle claims that Securities America brokers sold securities in fraudulent companies.

Ameriprise has been steadily boosting its assets under management and growing its client base (focusing on the affluent and mass affluent with at least $100,000 in investable assets). The company also is focused on geographic areas where those clients are congregated and has closed or consolidated offices in areas with less potential. While Columbia Management covers Ameriprise's main asset management market in the US, the company is increasing its global presence through its Threadneedle brand overseas. Ameriprise plans to grow its asset management operations in Europe, as well as in Australia, the Middle East, and Asia.

Ameriprise's strategies have paid off. Volatile financial market conditions, which negatively impacted all of the company's operations, led to a decline in revenue in 2008 and 2009. However, the company returned to success in 2010 and revenues grew by more than 20% that year. Poor economic conditions continued in 2011. However, Ameriprise's operating net revenues climbed that year by about 10%. The boost was due to strong growth in the company's fee-based advisory and asset management businesses.

Financial Analysis

The company's growth strategies helped Pacific Life achieve strong results in 2011, with revenues increasing 15% over 2010 to almost 6.7 billion, and net income increasing 29% to $679 million. Its operating income climbed a whopping 40% over 2010 to reach $823 million. The gains achieved were attributed to enhanced service offerings, expanded life insurance, annuity, and mutual fund product offerings, and the two acquisitions made that year.

Strategy

Being a mutual company, Pacific Life operates with a long-term focus to serve in the best interests of its policyholders and clients. in doing so, the company navigated the chilly economic waters of the 2008-2009 recession by steadily introducing new products and building up its capital reserves. By 2010 its net income had grown as risk-weary customers squirreled more of their savings and retirement monies into life insurance and mutual funds.

Mergers, Acquisitions & Divestitures

In 2008 the company added international reinsurance to its portfolio when it acquired the former London-based specialty reinsurance operations of Scottish Re and renamed the business as Pacific Life Re. It then added life retrocession (reinsurance of a reinsurer) to its line-up in 2011 by acquiring that business from Manulife and expanded its business to include the Toronto, Boston, Barbados, and Cologne markets.

Also in 2011 Pacific life bought JPMorgan Chase's pension risk advisory business to form Pacific Global Advisors. The unit offers risk management solutions and advisory services to pension plan sponsors.

The firm divested a noncore business, College Savings Bank, in 2012 to a syndicate of investors for an undisclosed price. The banking unit managed two state-sponsored 529 college savings plans. – less",SEO Specialist,$56K-$106K,"Search engine algorithms and ranking factors Keyword research and analysis On-page and off-page SEO optimization SEO tools (e.g., Google Analytics, SEMrush) SEO content strategy",Bern

The utility holding company distributes electricity to 3.4 million customers and natural gas to 1.9 million in eight states through four regulated utilities; Colorado and Minnesota account for most of its customers. Its utilities -- Northern States Power (NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin), Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service (in New Mexico and Texas) -- have the combined capacity of more than 17,150 MW of electricity. Xcel owns transmission and distribution lines, as well as natural gas assets. It is also the top wind power provider in the US, with wind farms in Colorado, Minnesota, and Texas.

Geographic Reach

The company serves customers in Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin.

 

Operations

Xcel operates power and gas utilities: Northern States Power, Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service. The holding company has more than 80 generating plants, more than 87,750 miles of transmission lines and about 191,840 miles of distribution lines. It also operates an interstate natural gas pipeline company and a joint venture to develop and lease natural gas pipelines, storage, and compression assets.

Financial Analysis

In 2011 Xcel reported a 3% jump in sales due to an increase in demand caused by a warmer-than-normal summer and a colder-than-normal winter. It was also assisted by a 3.7% increase in the electric segment due to cost recovery of the acquisition of the Rocky Mountain and Blue Spruce natural gas facilities by Public Service Company of Colorado and by natural gas retail rate increases in Minnesota.

Net income rose by 11% thanks to higher revenues and lower electric fuel and purchased power costs.

Higher rates and increased weather-related demand helped sales in 2010 to rise nearly 7%, going from $9.6 billion to about $10.3 billion. 

Strategy

Xcel is an energy company in transition, with long-term plans to move from coal-fired plants to natural gas, and on to alternative fuels such as wind, solar, and biomass to boost its green  power capacity (88,705 MWh by 2015).

In 2012 the company was seeking proposals for renewable resources other than wind or solar as part of its plan to diversify Southwestern Public Service Company  renewable energy portfolio.

As the largest US utility wind energy provider, Xcel controlled some 3,500 MW of wind energy in its portfolio in 2011 and plans to have 7,400 MW by 2020. In 2011 Xcel bought the 200 MW Limon Wind Energy Center, which will have 125 turbines in Lincoln and Elbert counties on Colorado's Front Range east of Denver. The company is also the US's fifth-largest utility solar energy provider and owns the fourth-largest transmission system. In addition, Xcel operates more than 25 hydroelectric power plants in Colorado, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.

The company believes its strategy of making environmentally sound investments is pivotal to its success. Among its 2010 projects were launching its 800-MW coal-fired unit in Colorado, known as Comanche 3, after installing advanced emission-reduction equipment. It also began construction of its CapX2020 project, a joint venture transmission expansion project with 10 other utilities, scheduled for completion by 2020. The project includes a 240-mile transmission line from Minnesota to North Dakota. The company has filed to extend the licensing plants of its two nuclear plants on Prairie Island in Minnesota for 20 years, which it expects to save customers more than $1 billion compared to alternative sources.

Xcel plans to construct one of the largest biomass generating plants in the Midwest. The facility, proposed for the Bay Front Generating Station in Ashland, Wisconsin, will generate power from burning wood waste in all three operating units by 2014. In 2011 Xcel had 73 MW of biomass generating power in Minnesota and Wisconsin.

Xcel is also working to develop so-called ""smart grid"" technology, which will provide customers with more reliability and control over their energy use. It has completed the nation's first fully integrated SmartGridCity in Boulder, Colorado.

In 2010 Xcel acquired two gas-fired power plants from Calpine Corporation for $739 million. The two Denver-area plants have a generating capacity of more than 900 MW and were already providing power to Public Service Company of Colorado under a contract agreement. The company is planning to acquire 775 MW of new wind-power capacity for its Colorado system over the next several years. – less",Structural Engineer,$64K-$100K,"Structural engineering principles Structural analysis and design software (e.g., AutoCAD, SAP2000) Building codes and standards Project management Structural integrity assessment",Banjul

In 2011 Xcel bought the 200 MW Limon Wind Energy Center, which will have 125 turbines in Lincoln and Elbert counties on Colorado's Front Range east of Denver. The company is also the US's fifth-largest utility solar energy provider and owns the fourth-largest transmission system. In addition, Xcel operates more than 25 hydroelectric power plants in Colorado, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.

The company believes its strategy of making environmentally sound investments is pivotal to its success. Among its 2010 projects were launching its 800-MW coal-fired unit in Colorado, known as Comanche 3, after installing advanced emission-reduction equipment. It also began construction of its CapX2020 project, a joint venture transmission expansion project with 10 other utilities, scheduled for completion by 2020. The project includes a 240-mile transmission line from Minnesota to North Dakota. The company has filed to extend the licensing plants of its two nuclear plants on Prairie Island in Minnesota for 20 years, which it expects to save customers more than $1 billion compared to alternative sources.

Xcel plans to construct one of the largest biomass generating plants in the Midwest. The facility, proposed for the Bay Front Generating Station in Ashland, Wisconsin, will generate power from burning wood waste in all three operating units by 2014. In 2011 Xcel had 73 MW of biomass generating power in Minnesota and Wisconsin.

Xcel is also working to develop so-called ""smart grid"" technology, which will provide customers with more reliability and control over their energy use. It has completed the nation's first fully integrated SmartGridCity in Boulder, Colorado.

In 2010 Xcel acquired two gas-fired power plants from Calpine Corporation for $739 million. The two Denver-area plants have a generating capacity of more than 900 MW and were already providing power to Public Service Company of Colorado under a contract agreement. The company is planning to acquire 775 MW of new wind-power capacity for its Colorado system over the next several years. – less",User Experience Designer,$56K-$126K,"User-centered design principles UX/UI design tools (e.g., Sketch, Adobe XD) Wireframing and prototyping Usability testing and user research Information architecture and user flows",San Salvador

It's the #3 broadline foodservice distributor in the US (behind SYSCO and U.S. Foodservice). Through its Foodservice division, PFG supplies more than 68,000 products to independent restaurants, hotels, other hospitality operators, and healthcare facilities through some 20 distribution facilities. The PFG Customized distribution unit serves chain restaurants such as Cracker Barrel and Ruby Tuesday. PFG subsidiary Vistar is a distributor of candy, snacks, and convenience foods for vending operators, retailers, and concessions. The company is owned by The Blackstone Group and Wellspring Capital Management, which took the business private in 2008.

Operations

With the $1.3 billion buyout in 2008 PFG was merged with Colorado-based Vistar (which was already controlled by Blackstone) to create a giant in the foodservice distribution industry with tentacles reaching into several markets. The combined business continues to operate under the PFG name, although each unit maintains its own headquarters. Across the company's foodservice, Vistar, and customized distribution businesses PFG collectively delivers more than 98,000 national- and proprietary-branded food and food-related products to more than 128,000 customers. As part of its operations, PFG maintains about 70 distribution centers and more than a dozen Merchant's Mart locations in the US.

Strategy

For PFG's broadline Performance Foodservice division, the focus has been on building the range of products it distributes to existing customers while improving margins. The division's more than 41,000 customers, located in about 40 countries, include franchisees of such chains as Burger King, Popeyes (owned by AFC Enterprises), and Subway. It also serves contract foodservice operators, such as Compass Group North America.

Mergers and Acquisitions

The company moved to expand its broadline division in mid-2012 by acquiring Carolina-based rival Institution Food House from Alex Lee. It also entered into an agreement in late 2012 to buy independent broadline foodservice distributor Fox River Foods, which serves seven states primarily in the Upper Midwestern region. The deals followed PFG's purchase in 2010 of Ledyard Company, which serves central and northern California. To add breadth to its product offering at its New England and Ohio offices, PFG in 2010 bought out the assets of VME Distributors. The wholesale supplier catered to mobile caterers, office coffee services, schools, prisons, and vending operators that do business in New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. – less",Inventory Manager,$64K-$116K,Inventory control Demand forecasting Supply chain management Data analysis Warehouse management,Tbilisi
